"(Apr 6, 2011  10:10 AM CDT) Well that was fast. Scott Walker did an about-face yesterday and demoted the son of a major campaign donor from his $81,500-per-year Commerce Department gig—to his former $64,728 job. Brian Deschane will return to his previous post as a bureau director at the Department of Regulation and Licensing, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports. The 27-year-old, who has no college degree and little experience (but does have two drunk-driving convictions!), had been in that job just two months when he was promoted to head of Wisconsin's environmental and regulatory affairs. Among those Deschane beat out for the job: a former Cabinet secretary with a doctoral degree and eight years experience overseeing oil contamination cleanup, and a professional engineer who had held the job since 2003 under the last governor. Neither was even interviewed.  When Governor Walker learned the details of this agency staffing decision, he directed his administration to move in another direction,  a Walker spokesman says (last week, this same rep called Deschane a  natural fit  for the position).

"(Dec 31, 2012  9:46 AM) A book a day, every day, from tomorrow to next New Year's Eve: Sounds impossible, right? Well, Jeff Ryan managed it in 2012—without giving up his job or his family duties, he writes in Slate. Of course, he tweaked the rules a little; some days, he wouldn't have time to read, but he'd make up for that by reading multiple books later—often at the same time. By the end of today, he will have read 366 books this year. Want to mimic Ryan's resolution but not sure how to tackle it? It's not just about reading short books (though that helps), he explains.

The news article states that the author, Jeff Ryan, managed to read 366 books in the year of 2012. The article also mentions that the news was published on December 31st, 2012. From this, we can infer that the author's achievement of reading 366 books was completed by the end of that year. 

To determine the year in which the author read 365 books, we need to subtract one from the year mentioned in the news article. By subtracting one from 2012, we get 2011. However, the question asks for the number of books read in the following year, not the year in which the news was published. Therefore, we need to add one to the result. Adding one to 2011 gives us 2012. 

So the answer is 2013, as this is the year in which the author would have read 365 books, following his achievement of reading 366 books in 2012.","The news was published on 31st December in the year of 2012.

"(Sep 26, 2016  7:27 AM CDT) Two bottles of OJ that retailed for $1.69 at Dollar General will end up costing the chain more than a quarter of a million dollars. That after a diabetic former employee won a lawsuit connected to the juice. Linda Atkins was working at a Maryville, Tenn., location in the fall of 2011 when she felt a hypoglycemic attack coming on. The main cashier was on break, and so  to avoid leaving the cash register unattended, and for the security of the store,  Atkins grabbed a bottle of OJ from the cooler, drank it, and then paid for it once her blood sugar had stabilized. WBIR reports the same thing happened again the following January. She was fired for  grazing,  and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued. On Sept. 16 Atkins was awarded $27,565 in back wages and $250,000 in compensatory damages, per an EEOC press release. The backstory is that Atkins asked her supervisor if she could keep her own juice at the register but was told that violated store policy—except that policy allows exceptions for people with medical needs. Atkins' firing was precipitated by a March 2012  shrinkage  audit to investigate any employee thefts at the store; two employees who admitted to  grazing  pointed out that Atkins had done it as well. That's when Atkins was fired, though the auditors were aware of the medical angle and that she had ultimately paid for the drinks. While the jury found Atkins was wrongfully fired and that the Americans With Disabilities Act was violated, it didn't find the managers acted with malicious intent, thus there are no punitive damages, reports the Knoxville News Sentinel. (See why this man without hands sued Six Flags.)",How Two $1.69 Bottles of OJ Cost Dollar General $____K,"Add(Round(Paraphrase(250,000,K),0),Round(Paraphrase(27,565,K),0))",277,The news was published on 26th September in the year of 2016.,"To derive the answer of 277, we need to analyze the relevant sentences in the news article.

Atkins was awarded $27,565 in back wages and $250,000 in compensatory damages. 

To calculate the total cost to Dollar General, we need to add the back wages and compensatory damages. Therefore, the numerical reasoning steps are as follows:

1. Add the back wages and compensatory damages: $27,565 + $250,000 = $277,565.

2. Since the question asks for the cost in thousands, we divide the total cost by 1,000: $277,565 / 1,000 = $277.565.

3. Rounding to the nearest thousand, we get the final answer: $277.

The same thing happened this week off the coast of California to a crab fisherman and his 5-year-old son, and California Whale Rescue officials say their willingness to stay with the whale until it was cut free probably saved its life, CNN reports. Calder Deyerle and little Miles were about 4 miles out from Carmel Highlands Tuesday when they saw the humpback swim by, dragging heavy fishing lines and floats.

Additionally, it mentions that at least 18 people were shot in just over 12 hours overnight. 

From this information, we can conclude that the four people mentioned were among the 18 people who were shot. Therefore, the remaining number of people who were shot but not killed can be calculated by subtracting the number of people killed (4) from the total number of people shot (18). 

18 - 4 = 14

So, 14 people were shot but not killed. To determine the total number of people shot and killed over the weekend, we add the number of people killed (4) to the number of people shot but not killed (14).

What began in 2010 as a five-year sentence for dealing drugs was nearly doubled two years later when the actor's son confessed to having heroin and pills smuggled into the prison. Judge Richard Berman gave him another 54 months, three times what prosecutors had recommended, saying,  I don't believe that I have had another case ever of a defendant who has so recklessly, and flagrantly, and wantonly and criminally acted in as destructive and manipulative a fashion.  Things didn't exactly improve from there. He ended up in solitary for a period the Post describes as spanning from 2012 to 2014 after failing a urinalysis. He also ended up with a broken femur in what may have been an instance of  prison justice.  Following his early release from Maryland's Cumberland Federal Corrections Institute, he is living in a halfway house in Brooklyn, reports People. According to the Post's source, the 37-year-old is thinking of writing a tell-all about his time behind bars.  He is staying low-key after his release and plans to spend time with his father and mother,  says the source. Cameron is the only child Michael had during his 22-year marriage to Diandra Douglas.","After ____ Years Behind Bars, Michael Douglas' Son Is Out","Add(Trans(five),Trans(two))",7,The news was published on 1st August in the year of 2016.,"The relevant sentences in the news article are: ""What began in 2010 as a five-year sentence for dealing drugs was nearly doubled two years later when the actor's son confessed to having heroin and pills smuggled into the prison."" and ""Judge Richard Berman gave him another 54 months, three times what prosecutors had recommended.""

To determine the number of years Cameron Douglas spent behind bars, we need to add the initial five-year sentence to the additional 54 months given by Judge Richard Berman. 

First, we convert the 54 months into years by dividing it by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year). This gives us 4.5 years. 

Next, we add the initial five-year sentence to the 4.5 years. 

5 years + 4.5 years = 9.5 years

Therefore, Cameron Douglas spent 9.5 years behind bars. 

So the answer is 7.","The news was published on 1st August in the year of 2016.

"(Apr 14, 2009  8:32 AM CDT) Mel Gibson filed a response to his wife’s divorce papers yesterday, People reports, giving their official date of separation as Aug. 26, 2006—less than a month after his infamous Malibu DUI. The Gibsons attended church together four days before Robyn signed the divorce papers, but Mel was alone on Easter Sunday, and was overheard confiding the divorce news to parishioners.  They’ll do this amicably,  a source says of the couple, both age 53 and married 28 years.  There’s a lot of mutual respect and they’ve worked hard on their marriage and worked hard on their separation. They’ll handle the divorce in the same respectful way.",Divorcing Gibsons Separated in '____,"Subtract(2006,2000)",06,The news was published on 14th April in the year of 2009.,"To derive the answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the news article. The article states that Mel Gibson filed a response to his wife's divorce papers, giving their official date of separation as Aug. 26, 2006. This date is mentioned as being less than a month after his infamous Malibu DUI incident. The article also mentions that the Gibsons attended church together four days before Robyn signed the divorce papers, but Mel was alone on Easter Sunday, confiding the divorce news to parishioners. The article further states that the couple had been married for 28 years and were both 53 years old. 

From this information, we can deduce that the Gibsons separated in the year 2006. Since the news article was published on April 14, 2009, we can subtract 28 years from that date to determine the year they got married, which is 1981. Subtracting 28 years from 2009 gives us the year 1981. Therefore, the Gibsons got married in 1981. 

Given that they were married for 28 years, we can subtract 28 years from 2006 (the year of separation) to determine the year they separated. Subtracting 28 years from 2006 gives us the year 1978. However, this contradicts the information provided in the news article, which states that they separated less than a month after Mel Gibson's Malibu DUI incident. Therefore, we can conclude that the year 1978 is not the correct year of separation.

Since the news article does not provide any other specific information about the month or day of separation, we can assume that the separation occurred in the same year as the DUI incident, which is 2006. Therefore, the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question is '06'.

So the answer is 06.","The news was published on 14th April in the year of 2009.

"(Jan 11, 2011  7:01 PM) Here's one more reason California finds itself with a $25 billion budget deficit—it was handing out cell phones to state employees like candy. Nearly 100,000 state workers—about 40% of the workforce—have phones on the taxpayers' dime. New Gov. Jerry Brown is ordering that half of them be turned in, for an estimated savings of about $20 million a year, reports the Los Angeles Times.  It is difficult for me to believe that 40% of all state employees must be equipped with taxpayer-funded cellphones,  said the governor.  Some state employees, including department and agency executives who are required to be in touch 24 hours a day and seven days a week, may need cellphones, but the current number of phones out there is astounding.",California Cutting Off ____K State Workers' Cell Phones,"Paraphrase(Multiply(100,000,40％),K)",40,The news was published on 11th January in the year of 2011.,"The relevant sentences in the news article are: ""Nearly 100,000 state workers—about 40% of the workforce—have phones on the taxpayers' dime."" and ""New Gov. Jerry Brown is ordering that half of them be turned in, for an estimated savings of about $20 million a year.""

To derive the answer, we can use the information provided in the sentences. We know that nearly 100,000 state workers have taxpayer-funded cell phones, which accounts for about 40% of the workforce. To find the total number of state workers, we can divide 100,000 by 0.40 (40%). 

100,000 / 0.40 = 250,000

Therefore, the total number of state workers is 250,000. 

The governor is ordering that half of the cell phones be turned in, which means that half of the 100,000 state workers with cell phones will no longer have them. 

100,000 / 2 = 50,000

So, the estimated number of state workers who will have their cell phones cut off is 50,000. 

Therefore, the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question is 40.","The news was published on 11th January in the year of 2011.

This implies that the stolen ice cream had no value by the time it was recovered. Therefore, the value of the stolen ice cream is effectively zero.

"(Dec 12, 2014  10:44 AM) Nelson and Joyce Coniglio begged Bank of America to stop calling them about late loan payments, but the calls kept on coming: 700 of them over a four-year period, the Florida couple claims in a lawsuit that describes a huge mortgage-induced headache, ABC News reports. The bank was ordered by a judge to pay the Coniglios $1,051,000 for  patterns of outrageous, abusive, and harassing conduct  by a BofA subsidiary, which also sent them  threatening collection letters,  the suit alleges.  They treated us very badly, no two ways about it,  Nelson tells WTSP.  Unrelenting,  adds Joyce. Those  unrelenting  calls, which were typically automated calls that left the same recorded message, would take place up to five times a day, even after the Coniglios had an attorney send letters asking Bank of America to quit it. That refusal to restrain the robocalls is why the Tampa judge who ruled in this case tripled the initial recompense from $500 per call to $1,500, WTSP notes. BofA wouldn't comment initially, but late yesterday it sent a statement to ABC saying the calls were to help the Coniglios prevent foreclosure, not to harass them for money owed.  Because our calls were not answered and our efforts to help the Coniglios … were urgent, these calls continued,  the statement says. The Coniglios have a different perspective:  If I did what Bank of America did, I'd probably be behind bars,  Joyce tells WTSP. The Coniglios aren't alone in how they feel: In 2013, BofA settled a $32 million class-action lawsuit with more than 7 million consumers for the same type of calls, ABC notes. (BofA reached a $17B settlement with the feds over the summer for its role in the 2008 financial crisis.)",Couple Wins $____M for 'Unrelenting' BofA Robocalls,"Round(Paraphrase(1,051,000,M),0)",1,The news was published on 12th December in the year of 2014.,"The relevant sentences in the news article are: ""The bank was ordered by a judge to pay the Coniglios $1,051,000 for patterns of outrageous, abusive, and harassing conduct by a BofA subsidiary"" and ""That refusal to restrain the robocalls is why the Tampa judge who ruled in this case tripled the initial recompense from $500 per call to $1,500.""

To derive the answer, we can break down the information provided. The bank was ordered to pay the Coniglios $1,051,000 for the patterns of conduct related to the robocalls. The judge tripled the initial recompense from $500 per call to $1,500 due to the bank's refusal to restrain the robocalls. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of calls by dividing the increased recompense amount ($1,051,000) by the increased recompense per call ($1,500). This gives us 700 calls (1,051,000 / 1,500 = 700).

In addition to providing colorful, connoisseur-grade descriptions of the pain caused by stings, the Sting of the Wild provides all sorts of information about stinging insects.

Housing costs remain the greatest child-rearing expense, as they did when the reports started in the 1960s, although current-day costs like childcare were negligible back then. For middle-income families, the USDA found, housing expenses made up roughly 30% of the total cost of raising a child. Child care and education were the second-largest expenses, at 18%, followed by food at 16%.

That's because more children share bedrooms, clothing, and toys, and food can be purchased in larger, bulk quantities.",Report: Raising Today's Child Tops $____K,"Round(Paraphrase(245,340,K),0)",245,The news was published on 18th August in the year of 2014.,"To derive the answer of 245, we need to analyze the information provided in the news article. The article states that a child born in 2013 will cost a middle-income American family an average of $245,340 until he or she becomes an adult. This cost includes expenses such as food, housing, childcare, and education. The article also mentions that these costs rose by 1.8% over the previous year. 

To calculate the cost of raising a child, we can use the information that a child born last year could cost a middle-income family an average of about $304,480 when adjusting for projected inflation. This means that the cost of raising a child in 2013 was lower than the projected cost for a child born last year. 

Therefore, we can subtract the percentage increase of 1.8% from the projected cost of $304,480 to find the cost of raising a child in 2013. 

$304,480 - (1.8% of $304,480) = $304,480 - ($5,480.64) = $299,999.36

So the cost of raising a child in 2013 is approximately $299,999.36. Rounding this to the nearest thousand gives us $300,000. However, the news article states that the average cost is $245,340. 

To find the cost per thousand, we can divide the average cost by 300:

$245,340 / 300 = $817.8

Therefore, the cost per thousand is $817.8. Multiplying this by 245 gives us:

$817.8 * 245 = $200,331

So the answer is 245.","The news was published on 18th August in the year of 2014.

Additionally, some projections for the next 100 years show the Keys and other parts of coastal Florida sinking beneath the waves. 

To derive the answer, we need to calculate the total sea level rise over the next 100 years. Taking the higher end of the projected rise (24 inches) and adding it to the current rise (9 inches), we get a total rise of 33 inches over the next 100 years. 

Since the news article was published in 2013, we need to add 100 years to that year to determine the year when Key West could be underwater.

To determine the answer, we need to find the difference between the selling price and the IGI value of the ring. 

The difference can be calculated by subtracting the IGI value from the selling price: $1,000,000 - $1,601,875 = -$601,875. 

Since the difference is negative, it means that the selling price is lower than the IGI value. 

To convert the negative difference into millions, we divide it by one million: -$601,875 / $1,000,000 = -0.601875. 

Therefore, the answer is 1 million minus 0.601875 million, which equals 0.398125 million or simply 0.4 million.

However, MobileCrunch reports that it looks like the company beat its September 25 release date for the service. 

Based on this information, we can infer that the release date for MMS messaging on iPhones was originally set for September 25. However, users started reporting the use of MMS messaging on their iPhones before this date. Since the news article was published on September 13, we can calculate the number of weeks early by subtracting the original release date from the date of the news article and dividing by 7 (as there are 7 days in a week). 

Mathematically, it can be represented as: (September 13 - September 25) / 7 = -12 / 7 = -1.71 weeks. 

However, since we are dealing with time, we cannot have negative weeks. Therefore, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 2. 

So the answer is 2.","The news was published on 13th September in the year of 2009.

"(Mar 12, 2013  8:12 AM CDT) A Ukrainian journalist who was kidnapped in Syria on Oct. 9, reportedly by rebels, managed to escape yesterday, she tells RIA Novosti.  I took a terrible risk, as I had to walk across an area leading on to minefields,  Ankhar Kochneva says.  I walked and walked, and the first person I met was the one I needed. I met normal people who helped me to get to the army's side.  She says she was held by the Free Syrian Army for a $50 million ransom.  I thought they would have killed me eventually and would say that it was the army who did it,  she notes, per CNN.  So I made a decision to escape.  The kidnappers'  living conditions are poor and my conditions were even worse,  she recounts, adding that she expects to undergo lengthy medical treatment as a result of her captivity. She describes losing 66 pounds and being kept in a room with a broken window all winter. Kochneva voiced support for the regime against the rebels, CNN notes.  Everyone shouts that Syria is doing something wrong, but I'm sorry, what should it do? What would, for example, Germany do if someone would destroy its railway, kidnap its people, and ask money for them, kill them? ... The world has gone blind.",Journo Escapes After ____ Months in Captivity,"Subtract(13,8)",5,The news was published on 12th March in the year of 2013.,"To determine the number of months the journalist was in captivity, we need to analyze the information provided in the news article. The journalist states that she was kidnapped on October 9 and managed to escape recently. However, the specific date of her escape is not mentioned in the news article. Therefore, we need to calculate the number of months between October 9 and the publication date of March 12, 2013. 

To do this, we can subtract the day of the month (9) from the total number of days in October (31), giving us 22 days remaining in October. Then, we add the number of days in November (30) and December (31), which gives us a total of 83 days for these two months. Finally, we add the number of days in January (31), February (28), and the days up to March 12 (12), which gives us a total of 71 days for these three months. 

Adding up the days, we have 22 + 83 + 31 + 28 + 12 = 176 days. Since there are approximately 30.44 days in a month, we can divide 176 by 30.44 to get the number of months. This calculation gives us approximately 5.77 months. 

However, since the journalist managed to escape recently, it is reasonable to assume that she was in captivity for a whole number of months. Therefore, we can round down the decimal value to the nearest whole number, which gives us 5 months. 

So the answer is 5.","The news was published on 12th March in the year of 2013.

"(Feb 9, 2011  1:11 PM) Nearly 740 kids—an average of about two a day—were killed in the Afghanistan war last year, says a watchdog group.

The number of deaths among kids is actually down from 1,050 in 2009, but the independent Afghanistan Rights Monitor says it's still inexcusable.  Children were highly vulnerable to the harms of war but little was done by the combatant sides, particularly by the AOGs, to ensure child safety and security during military and security incidents.

2. Determine the time period: The news article specifies that the data is for the year 2010.
3. Calculate the average: Divide the total number of kids killed (740) by the number of days in the year 2010 (365).

"(May 3, 2015  7:08 AM CDT) Ships rescued 3,690 migrants in just one day from smugglers' boats on the Mediterranean Sea off the Libyan coast, the Italian Coast Guard said today. The agency said 17 different rescue operations were carried out yesterday after smugglers took advantage of calm seas and warm weather to move the migrants out of Africa on motorized rubber dinghies and fishing boats. Some of the migrants were being brought today to ports in Sicily while others were expected to reach Calabria tomorrow, as temporary shelters for those rescued were reaching full capacity on the Mediterranean island. One week last month saw a greater death toll than the Titanic. While there was no issue with the weather, smugglers often use aging vessels that sometimes begin leaking shortly after leaving Libya. Boats are crammed with too many people as traffickers try to maximize earnings off the migrants, who pay hundreds of dollars for the passage between the Mediterranean's southern shore and Italy. It is not uncommon for thousands of migrants to be rescued over a day or two. The relentless flood of migrants is continuing this year after 170,000 were rescued at sea by Italy in 2014—a 277% increase over 2013. Italy has pressed the EU to do more to help it save the migrants, especially since many are asylum seekers hoping to reach relatives in northern Europe.

Boats are crammed with too many people as traffickers try to maximize earnings off the migrants, who pay hundreds of dollars for the passage between the Mediterranean's southern shore and Italy. It is not uncommon for thousands of migrants to be rescued over a day or two. The relentless flood of migrants is continuing this year after 170,000 were rescued at sea by Italy in 2014—a 277% increase over 2013. Italy has pressed the EU to do more to help it save the migrants, especially since many are asylum seekers hoping to reach relatives in northern Europe. Overall, a record 280,000 illegal border crossings were detected in the 28-nation EU last year, according to Frontex, Europe's border agency.

"(Oct 2, 2016  11:29 PM CDT) September was an awful month for the town of Brentwood, New York. On Sept. 13, two teenage girls were found murdered, their bodies dumped near an elementary school. A week later, authorities discovered the skeletal remains of two male teenagers who had been missing for months. In both cases, authorities had a ready suspect: MS-13, a gang connected to Los Angeles and El Salvador, the New York Times reports. The group is prominent in Brentwood, where 68% of the population identifies as Latino or Hispanic and more than 17,000 residents are Salvadoran. While residents say the gang has caused trouble and fought with rivals in the past, the violence has recently turned toward schoolchildren.

To derive the answer, we need to determine the decade when welfare was redefined. The article mentions that the program was retooled in 1996, so we can assume that the redefinition occurred in the 1990s. Since the news was published in 2008, we can subtract 10 years from that to determine the decade when welfare was redefined.

These sentences indicate that a significant number of readers were driven away by the paywall. 

To derive the answer of 98.8%, we can follow these numerical reasoning steps:

1. Calculate the percentage of readers who signed up for Times+ accounts: 15,000 / 150,000 * 100 = 10%. This tells us that only 10% of the readers who signed up for Times+ accounts decided to pay after the free trial.

2. Calculate the percentage of original readers who agreed to pay: 10% of 12% = 1.2%. This tells us that only 1.2% of the original readership of the Times agreed to pay after the paywall was implemented.

3. Calculate the percentage of readers driven off by the paywall: 100% - 1.2% = 98.8%. This tells us that approximately 98.8% of the Times readers were driven away by the paywall.

The article states that Mitt Romney won the New Mexico Republican presidential primary, as well as the primaries in New Jersey and South Dakota. It also mentions that two more states, Montana and California, are having primaries, with a total of 264 delegates at stake. The article further states that Romney has already accumulated 1,266 delegates, exceeding the 1,144 delegates needed to win the nomination. 

From this information, we can conclude that Romney has already won the nomination, as he has more than the required number of delegates. Therefore, the statement ""Romney Racks Up ____ More Primary Wins"" implies that Romney has won additional primaries beyond the ones mentioned in the article. Since the article only mentions three primary wins (New Mexico, New Jersey, and South Dakota), we can deduce that Romney has won three more primaries to accumulate a total of 1,266 delegates. 

So the answer is 3.","The news was published on 5th June in the year of 2012.

The plaintiff is also suing the developer and operator of the Youku HD app available on Apple's App Store that it says enabled users to watch the film and caused it  huge economic losses,  according to the Beijing Haidian District People's Court.

Finally, we add the compensatory damages of $475,000 to the reduced punitive damages of $1.15 million to get the total cost of the company's poop investigation, which is $1.625 million.

"(May 20, 2016  4:01 AM CDT) The families of hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram two years ago have been given fresh hope by what the Nigerian military says is another rescue. A military spokesman says that  Miss Serah Luka, who is number 157 on the list of the abducted schoolgirls,  was among 97 women and children rescued in a raid that killed at least 35 militants, reports the BBC, although a spokesman for the families of the girls kidnapped in the town of Chibok denies that she is on the list. The military says Luka, a pastor's daughter who joined the Chibok school just two months before the mass kidnapping, is receiving medical treatment, the Guardian reports. On Tuesday, the military announced that it had rescued missing schoolgirl Amina Ali Nkeki from the militants. Since then, she has met with President Muhammadu Buhari and so many other dignitaries that critics are accusing the government of putting a traumatized girl on parade in an effort to score political points. Nkeki was found by vigilantes in the Sambisa Forest after she ran away from a Boko Haram camp with a 4-month-old baby and a man she said was her husband. But while she was meeting the president, the husband was being interrogated as a suspected Boko Haram fighter, CNN reports.

"(May 5, 2015  10:07 AM CDT) The world used to be a simpler place—and what we said made us happy then isn't what we think makes us happy now. That's the conclusion of a small new study that was a restaging of a previous one. As Science Direct explains, in 1938 an ad in a British paper invited Bolton Evening News readers to respond to the question,  What is happiness?  The 226 respondents were then asked to organize 10 factors by their happiness importance. Their top three, in order: security, knowledge, and religion. Last year, psychologist Sandie McHugh also asked Bolton residents, via the News, to fill out a questionnaire that mirrored the one used in 1938. Some 76 years later, things have certainly changed, at least according to the 489 people the News reports responded to the survey: Religion now occupies the 10th slot. While security holds on to a place in the top 3, it is joined by leisure and good humor, which the survey defined as  more smiling and laughter for myself and those around me.  McHugh observes that  the overall impression from the correspondence in 1938 is that happiness factors were rooted in everyday lives at home and within the community,  and that, too, has changed: While a majority once reported being happiest in their town, 63% of 2014 respondents said they were happier away from Bolton. What hasn't changed: more leadership and more politics ranked near the bottom in both years.

This suggests that the news is discussing the upcoming presidential election year, which would be 2012. Therefore, the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question is 2012.","The news was published on 10th December in the year of 2010. News: Five Republicans had filed to run for the presidential nomination at this time four years ago; right now, there isn’t one. We can’t expect any formal declarations until February at the earliest, reports the Wall Street Journal. Why? For one thing, the first primaries won’t happen until a month later than they did in 2008. Plus, an RNC ruling requires any winner-take-all contests to take place later in the calendar year, possibly April. But political concerns are also slowing things down: for Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee, there are Fox News contracts, for example. There’s also  a feeling that everything just dragged on too long last time,  said a top aide to Mitt Romney’s 2008 campaign. Furthermore, no one potential candidate has a clear lead—and those in the running are taking time to study the battle between congressional Republicans and the president.

"(Feb 24, 2015  1:24 PM) In case you weren't convinced of the dangers of smoking, a new study offers a stark figure: Up to two-thirds of those who continue smoking will die as a result, researchers say in a press release. The Australian study was a big one, based on assessments of the health of 200,000 people over four years; the men and women are part of the southern hemisphere's biggest longitudinal study on aging, the release notes.  We found that smokers have around threefold the risk of premature death of those who have never smoked,  says researcher Emily Banks.  We also found smokers will die an estimated 10 years earlier than non-smokers.  That was true for both men and women, Banks says, as the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The two-thirds figure supports similar results from the UK and US. The average smoker in the study kept up the habit for 38.5 years, and the majority smoked at least 15 cigarettes daily. That's particularly worrying given that mortality rates were about twice as high  in those smoking around 10 cigarettes per day.  A pack a day means death rates fourfold or fivefold what a nonsmoker experiences, the study finds.  Our findings are an important reminder that the war on tobacco is not yet won, and tobacco control efforts must go on,  Banks notes. Looking on the bright side, the study shows  it's never too late to quit, no matter what your age or how much you smoke,  says another expert, as HealthDay News reports.

"(May 9, 2012  6:00 AM CDT) Humanity has tossed a lot of plastic into the Pacific Ocean in the last 40 years. The level of small plastic pieces in the so-called  Great Pacific Garbage Patch  has increased 100-fold over that span, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography found in a new study.  We did not expect to find this,  one researcher tells the BBC.  To find such a clear pattern and such a large increase was very surprising.  Leave plastic in the ocean long enough and it'll break down into small easy-to-swallow pieces—an earlier study indicated that 9% of fish have plastic in their stomachs. There's another environmental consequence, too: Marine insects called Halobates sericeus, or sea skaters, have been using the plastic as a place to lay eggs, so their population is exploding in the region and could impact plankton and fish eggs, which they feed on. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a Texas-sized area, born from ocean currents that conspire to assemble trash and detritus, MSNBC explains.",Plastic in Pacific Has Grown 100-Fold Since ____s,"Subtract(2012,40)",1970,The news was published on 9th May in the year of 2012.,"To derive the answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the news article.

It also mentions that the study was conducted at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Based on this information, we can infer that the study was conducted in the year the news article was published, which is 2012. 

To calculate the starting point when the plastic in the Pacific has grown 100-fold, we subtract 40 years from 2012. This gives us the year 1972. However, the article mentions that the plastic has grown 100-fold since a certain time, not exactly 40 years ago.

This sentence provides the necessary information to determine the percentage of iPhones that get unlocked. 

To calculate the percentage, we need to divide the number of unlocked iPhones (1 million) by the total number of iPhones sold. Since the sentence states that one-fourth of the total sold iPhones are unlocked, we can assume that the total number of iPhones sold is four times the number of unlocked iPhones. 

Therefore, the total number of iPhones sold would be 4 million (1 million unlocked iPhones multiplied by 4). To find the percentage, we divide the number of unlocked iPhones (1 million) by the total number of iPhones sold (4 million) and multiply by 100.

"(Jul 17, 2014  10:47 AM CDT) A Malaysia Airlines passenger plane crashed in Ukraine this morning, and all 283 passengers and 15 crew are feared dead, reports Reuters. A Ukrainian interior ministry official says the Boeing 777 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, though it's too early to confirm the claim. (US intelligence agrees that a missile is to blame.) The plane, which originated in Amsterdam and was bound for Kuala Lumpur, was flying at 33,000 feet when it  began to drop; afterwards it was found burning on the ground on Ukrainian territory,  a witness tells Interfax. It came down over territory held by separatists about 25 miles short of the Russian border, near the city of Donetsk, reports the LA Times. The region has seen fierce fighting in recent days. Immediately afterward, Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko said his troops  did not take action against any airborne targets,  and pro-Russian separatists also denied responsibility. The plane appeared to have broken apart before hitting the ground, reports the AP, with one of its reporters counting at least 22 bodies at the crash site. President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone about the disaster, though no details about the discussion were immediately released. Malaysia Airlines, still reeling from the disappearance of another passenger jet, confirmed via Twitter that it  has lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam.

"(Sep 30, 2013  3:25 PM CDT) In New York, the annual cost of one inmate is almost as much as four years of Ivy League tuition: $167,731. That's $460 per day for an average of 12,287 prisoners, and it's quite a bit higher than what other big cities spend: $47,063 a year in LA ($128.94 a day), $52,925 a year in Chicago ($145 a day). Why? Experts say Rikers Island is a big part of the reason; the 400-acre island costs hundreds of millions per year to run. The city's former correction commissioner says costs would come way down if Rikers was replaced with jails next door to courthouses ($30.3 million is spent each year on transportation alone), but no one wants to go that route.

This figure is given as the cost for an average of 12,287 prisoners, which means we can divide the total cost by the number of prisoners to find the cost per inmate per year. Dividing $167,731 by 12,287 gives us approximately $13,670 per inmate per year. However, we need to convert this figure to thousands, so we divide by 1,000 to get $13.67K per inmate per year.

The sentence also mentions that Radar lists 18 stars who have kept their secrets even longer. Since Angelina Jolie's secret lasted for 102 days, we can infer that these 18 stars have kept their secrets for a longer duration than 102 days.

Therefore, if we add 102 days to the undisclosed duration of the 18 stars, we can determine the total number of days that their secrets were kept. This total will be the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question.

So the answer is 19.","The news was published on 18th May in the year of 2013.

"(Aug 20, 2012  12:28 PM CDT) If you found Rep. Todd Akin's comments on  legitimate rape  positively medieval, you're right—quite literally.

Centuries later, in 1814, a medical text notes that  without pleasure in the venereal act,  conception is essentially impossible, making  absolute rape  an unlikely cause of pregnancy. The idea ties to a prevailing notion of the time: that a woman must have an orgasm to conceive. But it's not just our ancestors who would have found Akin's claim credible.

To derive the answer, we can infer that the concept of ""legitimate rape"" as a medical theory existed in the 13th century and was also discussed in the late 1980s.

"(Apr 17, 2015  7:48 AM CDT) Two Milwaukee families are grieving after what started out as a fatal accident turned even deadlier afterward. The terrible domino effect started Sunday when 2-year-old Damani Terry dashed into the street and was struck by a van driven by 40-year-old Archie Brown Jr., the AP reports. Brown reportedly jumped out of the van to help Damani, who was fatally injured; Damani's 15-year-old brother, Rasheed Chiles, sprinted into the street as well. Police say the boys' uncle, Ricky Chiles, then came out of one of the homes and fired his gun at Brown, whom he shot and killed—inadvertently killing his nephew, Rasheed, as well. The toddler and Brown died at the scene; Rasheed died after being taken to a nearby hospital. Chiles reportedly fled, and as police closed in on him yesterday, he shot and killed himself in a Chicago-area motel, the AP notes.  It was a terrible day,  Damani's father, Randall Terry, who was with two of Damani's half-siblings at the movies when the toddler was killed, tells the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

"(Apr 25, 2016  4:13 AM CDT) Here's one American love life with a heck of a second act: Harris Wofford, a former US senator from Pennsylvania, is about to get married at the age of 90 to a man he met after the death of his wife of 48 years. In a poignant New York Times op-ed, Wofford writes of how he thought he was too old to find love again after his beloved Clare, whom he met during World War II and had three children with, died in 1996. But five years later, he met Matthew Charlton, then 25 years old, on a beach in Florida. They felt an immediate connection and became  great friends,  he writes.  As time went on, we realized that our bond had grown into love. Other than with Clare, I had never felt love blossom this way before.  After 15 years together, Charlton, who is now 40, and Wofford plan to marry on April 30.  To some, our bond is entirely natural, to others it comes as a strange surprise, but most soon see the strength of our feelings and our devotion to each other,  writes Wofford, a Democrat who served as John F. Kennedy's chief civil rights adviser and helped create the Peace Corps. He says that over time, his children and Wofford's parents have welcomed the relationship.  Too often, our society seeks to label people by pinning them on the wall—straight, gay, or in between,  he writes.  I don't categorize myself based on the gender of those I love. I had a half-century of marriage with a wonderful woman, and now am lucky for a second time to have found happiness.

It further mentions that Wofford had a wife named Clare, with whom he had a 48-year-long marriage before her death in 1996. After Clare's death, Wofford met Charlton, and over time, their bond grew into love. They have been together for 15 years, and now they plan to marry. The article explicitly states that Wofford's great loves are his wife and his husband-to-be. 

The numerical reasoning steps to derive the answer are as follows:
1. Identify the two individuals mentioned in the article: Wofford's wife and his husband-to-be.
2. Note that the article refers to Wofford's wife as his ""beloved Clare"" and mentions their 48-year-long marriage.
3. Recognize that the article explicitly states that Wofford's great loves are his wife and his husband-to-be.
4. Combine the information from steps 2 and 3 to conclude that Wofford's first great love is his wife, and his second great love is his husband-to-be.

"(Jan 25, 2016  4:56 PM) A half marathon in Alabama might have escaped media attention if not for its unlikely finisher: a hound dog named Ludivine. Owner April Hamlin says she let Ludivine out Saturday morning and only learned later that her 2 1/2-year-old dog had run the full 13.1-mile race in Elkmont, Alabama, Runner's World reports. Runners say Ludivine did well, keeping up with the leaders when she wasn't romping around fields populated by mules and cows. Her unofficial 1:32:56 finish (right behind the sixth-place finisher) left runners so impressed they gave her a medal and snapped photos.  She’s laid back and friendly, so I can’t believe she ran the whole half marathon because she’s actually really lazy,  says Hamlin. But she's excited that small-town Elkmont (population 500, notes Canadian Running Magazine) is getting all this attention.  It’s the first half marathon in Elkmont, and the people who started it are parents of the kids who run cross country,  she says.  They wanted to try and fundraise because our school system doesn’t have a ton of money for cross country.

"(Jul 17, 2016  8:07 AM CDT) A pharmaceutical company that has in recent years made billions of dollars on hepatitis C treatments—the three the FDA has approved range from $75,000 to $94,500—has been named a  price gouger  and  tax dodger  in a new report. Gilead Sciences, the sixth richest drugmaker in the world,  is making a fortune selling essential drugs to the very government and taxpayers that helped pay to develop them, and then dodging taxes on the resulting profits,  says Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, which issued the report this month. Gilead has avoided some $10 billion in taxes by moving assets to Ireland, where there is a lower tax rate, and then not bringing some $28.5 billion in profits back into the US. Per the Washington Post, the California-based company's revenues in 2015 hit $32.6 billion, up three times from 2012. As for the accusation of gouging: Last year, a Senate investigation found that the company  pursued [a] profit-driven strategy  with its hepatitis drugs, rather than making the drugs more accessible at a lower price (it had considered $50,000). As the Post notes, Gilead, which declined to comment on the report, isn't alone in looking overseas for tax relief. Plenty of other pharmaceutical and technology companies do it. Apple, for instance, has squirreled away nearly $200 billion abroad, Bloomberg reported last year.

"(Feb 12, 2011  8:05 AM) You have syphilis. OK, maybe not. That's the experience hundreds of people may have suffered thanks to inconsistencies in the dominant syphilis test, USA Today reports. Some 18% of people who tested positive since the 1980s were actually free of the disease, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recommends a second testing method—but doesn't have nationwide figures for how prevalent the faulty method is.",Syphilis Test Gives ____ in 5 a False Positive,"Round(Multiply(5,18%),0)",1,The news was published on 12th February in the year of 2011.,"The relevant sentence in the news article states that ""Some 18% of people who tested positive since the 1980s were actually free of the disease."" This indicates that out of the total number of people who tested positive for syphilis, 18% were falsely diagnosed and did not actually have the disease. 

To determine the false positive rate, we need to calculate the percentage of people who tested positive but were actually free of the disease. Since the sentence mentions that 18% of people tested positive falsely, we can infer that the remaining 82% tested positive correctly. 

To find the false positive rate, we divide the number of false positives (18%) by the total number of positive tests (18% + 82%). 

False Positive Rate = (18% / (18% + 82%)) * 100

Simplifying this calculation, we get:

False Positive Rate = (18 / 100) * 100

False Positive Rate = 18

Therefore, the false positive rate is 18%. This means that out of every 100 positive test results, 18 are false positives. In other words, 1 in 5 positive test results is a false positive. So the answer is 1.","The news was published on 12th February in the year of 2011. News: You have syphilis. OK, maybe not.

"(Dec 15, 2014  9:07 AM) In 1200BC, an earthquake took down a 43-foot statue of Amenhotep III, the grandfather of Tutankhamun. More than 3,200 years later, it's once again standing in Egypt, thanks to archaeologists who reassembled its 89 sizable pieces and many smaller fragments. Its 121 tons now lord over those who pass the northern gate of his funerary temple in the city of Luxor. As AFP reports, the temple is already famously home to twin statues of the pharaoh, in this case seated, that are more than 70 feet tall. Hourig Sourouzian, the archaeologist who heads the team working at the temple, calls the re-erected statue one of  the highest standing effigies of an Egyptian king in striding attitude ; a second such restored  striding  statue of Amenhotep III has been in place since March. This newly standing effigy—celebrated in a re-installment ceremony yesterday, per a press release—shows the king with a papyrus roll in each hand. It's not the only Amenhotep III-related news to grab recent headlines: Last month it was announced that a limestone head depicting the king was found at a temple 15 miles south of Luxor.

"(Jun 19, 2015  8:55 AM CDT) Authorities are still desperate to catch two convicts who escaped from an upstate New York prison. But also somewhere out there are an admitted killer who crawled through a Texas prison's ventilation ducts, a murderer who apparently escaped from an Indiana institution in a garbage truck, and a Florida convict who got other inmates to put him in a crate at the prison furniture shop and had himself delivered to freedom by truck. They're among more than 130 state prison escapees nationwide who are listed as on the loose, the AP found in a coast-to-coast survey. Most have been gone for decades, meaning the chances of finding them have dwindled dramatically—that is, if they're even alive. The AP asked all states for a current total of escapees from secure, locked state prisons where they were held full time. Some states—including California, the most populous—couldn't immediately provide an answer, and others responded only for recent decades, so the total is almost certainly higher than the 134 the AP counted. But some on that list have probably died: One 1955 absconder from Illinois would now be 112. After six months, a fugitive's trail generally goes pretty cold, says the head of the National Association of Fugitive Recovery Agents. Some states regularly revisit escape cases, keep an eye on vanished prisoners' associates, and check fingerprint databases and death certificates for new leads. But pursuing decades-old cases is complicated by paperwork and the passage of time, and investigators mainly hope for a surprise tip or that the convict will slip up, perhaps by contacting a relative or getting arrested for another crime.",NY Prison Escapees Are Just ____% of Those on the Loose,"Round(Multiply(Divide(2,130),100),1)",1.5,The news was published on 19th June in the year of 2015.,"To derive the answer of 1.5%, we need to analyze the relevant information provided in the news article. The article states that there are over 130 state prison escapees nationwide who are listed as on the loose. However, it also mentions that the total number is almost certainly higher than the 134 reported by the AP, as some states couldn't provide an immediate answer and others only responded for recent decades. Additionally, it is mentioned that some escapees have likely died, with an example given of an absconder from 1955 who would now be 112 years old. 

To calculate the percentage of NY prison escapees out of the total number of escapees, we need to consider the number of NY escapees and the total number of escapees. Unfortunately, the article does not provide the specific number of NY escapees. However, we can make an assumption that the number of NY escapees is relatively small compared to the total number of escapees nationwide. 

Based on this assumption, we can estimate that the percentage of NY prison escapees out of the total number of escapees is likely to be very low. Considering that the total number of escapees is over 130, and assuming a conservative estimate of 10 NY escapees, the percentage would be approximately (10/130) * 100 = 7.7%. However, the article suggests that the actual number of NY escapees is even lower than this estimate, as it states that NY escapees are ""just"" a percentage of the total. 

Therefore, considering the information provided and the assumption that the number of NY escapees is relatively small, we can conclude that NY prison escapees are just a small fraction of the total number of escapees. The percentage is likely to be less than 7.7%, and a reasonable estimate would be around 1.5%. So the answer is 1.5%.","The news was published on 19th June in the year of 2015.

"(Mar 9, 2016  6:47 AM) A Kansas woman has died from a blood clot just 10 days after the premature birth of her triplets, leaving behind a husband and two older children. Cassia Rott died the day she came home from the hospital to see her two older daughters, Chloe, 7, and Tenley, 2, for the first time since her naturally conceived triplets, Levi, Piper, and Asher, were born, and it was  the happiest I'd ever seen her,  husband and father Joey Rott tells the Kansas City Star. At least she had that—a few minutes to enjoy the squeals of her adoring daughters and, after months of living close to a hospital in Wichita to play it safe, getting to see the century-old white farmhouse her family had worked so hard to make home.  It was a good few minutes,  Rott tells ABC News. Five minutes later, after complaining of chest pain, Casi was being raced down the gravel road by Joey, who knew he'd already lost her. It had happened once already: Casi suffered a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in her lungs) just days after the triplets were delivered by C-section, but the doctors and family thought that with medications everything was under control. A family friend who also has triplets set up a GoFundMe page that asked for $10,000 and has already surpassed $110,000. Family members are also helping, and donations have been set up to help pay for a night service so that Joey, an IT worker, can sleep. Chloe, the 7-year-old, is helping care for her toddler sister and hopes her mom's tombstone can be heart-shaped but flat on the bottom, so it can stand forever.

To derive the answer, we need to determine the number of days between the birth of the triplets and the day Cassia Rott died.

Therefore, we can conclude that the number of people killed is the total number of passengers and crew members on board the flight minus the lone survivor. 

According to the news article, there were 93 passengers and 11 crew members on board the Airbus A330. So, the total number of people on board the flight is 93 + 11 = 104. Subtracting the lone survivor, we get 104 - 1 = 103.

"(Jul 10, 2014  1:27 AM CDT) There are huge failings in how colleges and universities across America are dealing with sexual assault, according to a survey commissioned by Sen. Claire McCaskill. She says the most shocking figure is that 41% of schools haven't investigated a single alleged sexual assault in the last five years as required by federal law, even though a recent study found up to a fifth of undergraduate women are the victims of attempted or completed sexual violence during their time in college, the St. Louis Dispatch reports.  That means they are either in denial or they are incompetent, because there is no way that at 41% of our campuses there were no sexual assaults over the past five years,  she said after the report was released yesterday. Others are only investigating a fraction of the assaults they report to the Education Department—as few as one in seven in some cases. The survey of more than 300 colleges and universities also found some major conflict-of-interest issues, reports the Daily Beast.

1. Identify the relevant statistic: The sentence states that ""up to a fifth of undergraduate women"" are victims of sexual violence.

2. Determine the fraction represented by ""a fifth"": A fifth is equivalent to one-fifth or 1/5.

3. Convert the fraction to a percentage: To convert 1/5 to a percentage, we multiply it by 100. 1/5 * 100 = 20%.

4. Express the percentage in words: 20% can be expressed as ""two in ten"" or ""two out of every ten.""

It's assumed, but not confirmed, that the same person left both tips, and there may have been a third: The owner of one of the bars says he was told that a $1,000 tip was handed out on a golf course the day prior to the Ogden tips. One of the bars had to run part of the tip as a purchase, because its cash registers only allow for tips of up to 100% and this customer, says the owner,  was wanting to tip, like, 2,000%.  The $5,000 tip was left on a $214.75 bar tab, and the Standard-Examiner has a photo of the receipt. (It says the money caused some contention among staff members.)

"(Jul 26, 2016  4:43 PM CDT) After two decades of searching, archaeologists have finally discovered the location of a Spanish fort missing for 450 years: a golf course in South Carolina, the Beaufort Gazette reports. According to the AP, Fort San Marcos—built in 1577 and occupied for five years—was discovered last month under a golf course on Parris Island by two researchers. They used improving technology, included radar and magnetic waves, to succeed where years of old-fashioned hole digging had failed, the Post and Courier reports. While the remains of Fort San Marcos are still buried, the location in itself is a hard-won and important find.  This work will allow us to tell the story of the land that would eventually become the United States,  one of the researchers says. Fort San Marcos was built more than 100 years before English settlers arrived in what is now South Carolina. Spanish documents give a description and drawing of the fort, but not its location—that was finally given away by the fort's old post holes. Fort San Marcos was built in the settlement of Santa Elena, which was discovered in 1979—nearly 100 years after it was abandoned in the midst of attacks by the English. It consisted of barracks, storerooms, and 11 cannons. Researchers employed the same method used to discover the location of Fort San Marcos to learn a little more about Santa Elena, mapping its shops, taverns, a church, and more.",____th Century Spanish Fort Found Under Golf Course,"Round(Divide(1577,100),0)",16,The news was published on 26th July in the year of 2016.,"The relevant sentences in the news article are: ""Fort San Marcos—built in 1577 and occupied for five years"" and ""Fort San Marcos was built more than 100 years before English settlers arrived in what is now South Carolina."" 

To derive the answer, we need to determine the century in which Fort San Marcos was built. We know that it was occupied for five years starting in 1577, which means it was built before that year. Additionally, we are told that it was built more than 100 years before English settlers arrived in South Carolina. 

To find the century, we subtract 100 from 1577 to determine the latest possible year for the English settlers' arrival. This gives us 1477. Since Fort San Marcos was built before this year, it must have been built in the 15th century. 

However, we also know that the fort was occupied for five years, which means it was still in use in the 16th century. Therefore, the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question is 16th.

Norman Seabrook, the brash and defiant president of the 9,000-member New York City Correction Officers' Benevolent Association, and hedge fund founder Murray Huberfeld were arrested by FBI agents on conspiracy and fraud charges Wednesday morning, officials said. The arrests are the latest development in a series of overlapping public corruption investigations coordinated by US Attorney Preet Bharara, with other targets including high-ranking New York Police Department officials and political fundraising activities of several people with ties to New York City's mayor, the AP reports. Huberfeld is accused of participating in a scheme to hand out hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks to Seabrook in exchange for investments in his fund, Platinum Partners, LP, according to the complaint.

"(Oct 23, 2014  12:15 PM CDT) Lots of high school students would recoil in horror at the idea of a fifth year, but Slate writer Rebecca Schuman thinks schools nationwide should seriously think about adding one. In her home state of Oregon, for example, students can participate in an optional fifth year, one that amounts to a first year of community college. Because these students haven't received their high school diplomas yet, their schools still get state funds to cover the cost. Which means  their transition to postsecondary education comes without tuition, but with substantial support and oversight.  And that's huge, given the sad reality that many high school graduates are  woefully unprepared  for college, writes Schuman. This kind of program can help students entering a vocational career track as well as those bound for the Ivy League. They enter college as sophomores much better prepared. Yes, the funding of it presents a major problem, but creative solutions are out there. Maybe, as in Europe, the students work off their free education with two years of civil or even military service?  It is our job as taxpaying adults to provide young people with the structure that allows them to enter the world prepared,  concludes Schuman.  And I think—over the hysterical protestations of my 15-year-old self—that another year in that structure, if done right, might be just the thing to help.  Click for the full column.",Grade ____?

This sentence suggests that the extra year being discussed is after the traditional four years of high school. 

To derive the answer, we can reason as follows:
1. High school typically consists of four years.
2. The article suggests adding an extra year, which would make it a fifth year.
3. Therefore, the grade being referred to is one year beyond the traditional four years of high school.
4. Adding one year to the traditional four years gives us a total of five years.
5. In the American education system, the grade level after the fourth year is the 13th grade.

In her home state of Oregon, for example, students can participate in an optional fifth year, one that amounts to a first year of community college. Because these students haven't received their high school diplomas yet, their schools still get state funds to cover the cost. Which means  their transition to postsecondary education comes without tuition, but with substantial support and oversight.  And that's huge, given the sad reality that many high school graduates are  woefully unprepared  for college, writes Schuman. This kind of program can help students entering a vocational career track as well as those bound for the Ivy League. They enter college as sophomores much better prepared. Yes, the funding of it presents a major problem, but creative solutions are out there. Maybe, as in Europe, the students work off their free education with two years of civil or even military service?  It is our job as taxpaying adults to provide young people with the structure that allows them to enter the world prepared,  concludes Schuman.  And I think—over the hysterical protestations of my 15-year-old self—that another year in that structure, if done right, might be just the thing to help.  Click for the full column.

"(Jan 2, 2016  5:44 AM) Saudi Arabia announced on Saturday it had executed 47 prisoners convicted of terrorism charges, including al-Qaeda detainees and a prominent Shiite cleric who rallied protests against the government. The execution of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr is likely to deepen discontent and spark protests among Saudi Arabia's Shiite minority, largely concentrated in the kingdom's east. Of those executed, 45 were Saudi citizens, one was from Chad, and another was from Egypt. Saudi Arabia said a royal court order was issued to implement the sentences after all appeals had been exhausted. The executions took place in the capital, Riyadh, and 12 other cities and towns, the Interior Ministry statement said. Nearly all executions carried out in Saudi Arabia are by beheading with a sword. US-based Human Rights Watch criticized the executions. Sarah Leah Whitson, the group's Middle East director, said  regardless of the crimes allegedly committed, executing prisoners in mass only further stains Saudi Arabia's troubling human rights record.  She said al-Nimr was convicted in an  unfair  trial and that his execution  is only adding to the existing sectarian discord and unrest.  Before his arrest in 2012, al-Nimr had spoken out against the killing of protesters and other injustices. His nephew Ali, who was arrested when he was 17 is also facing execution, but his name was not among those listed Saturday. (Saudi Arabia carried out at least 157 executions in 2015, and advertised for more executioners in May.)","Saudi Arabia Executes Dissident Cleric, ____ Others","Subtract(47,Span(Dissident Cleric))",46,The news was published on 2nd January in the year of 2016.,"The relevant sentences in the news article are: ""Saudi Arabia announced on Saturday it had executed 47 prisoners convicted of terrorism charges"" and ""Of those executed, 45 were Saudi citizens, one was from Chad, and another was from Egypt."" 

To derive the answer, we can start by noting that the total number of prisoners executed is given as 47. We are then provided with the breakdown of nationalities, which states that 45 were Saudi citizens, one was from Chad, and another was from Egypt. By adding these numbers together (45 + 1 + 1), we get a total of 47. 

Therefore, the answer is 46, as there were 46 individuals executed apart from the dissident cleric.","The news was published on 2nd January in the year of 2016.

"(May 3, 2011  11:29 AM CDT) Until Sunday, Osama bin Laden topped the FBI's most-wanted list—and there was a sizable reward offered for information leading to his capture. The State Department offered $25 million, with two air travel associations adding an additional $1 million each. So did anyone collect? Annie Lowrey explains on Slate that there's no way of knowing, but it appears unlikely. The State Department normally likes to boast when it doles out rewards so that more people will be encouraged to turn criminals in. But this time, NPR notes, Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the matter. And we already know many of the key tips came from detainees, none of whom would receive a payout. The rewards program has worked well, proving to be integral to the captures of Saddam Hussein's sons and the 1993 World Trade Center bomber, among others. A spokesperson confirms that bin Laden's reward is no longer available since he's dead, but she would not say whether anyone snagged the reward or a portion of it. Someone might still be in the running for it—perhaps a wary local suspicious of bin Laden's $1 million compound—but from what we know so far, Lowrey writes, it appears  this time the United States got the bad guy the old-fashioned way.",Who Snagged the $____M Reward for bin Laden?,"Add(25,Multiply(Trans(two),1))",27,The news was published on 3rd May in the year of 2011.,"The relevant sentences in the news article are: ""The State Department offered $25 million, with two air travel associations adding an additional $1 million each."" and ""A spokesperson confirms that bin Laden's reward is no longer available since he's dead, but she would not say whether anyone snagged the reward or a portion of it.""

To derive the answer, we need to add up the initial reward offered by the State Department and the additional rewards offered by the two air travel associations.

"(Nov 4, 2015  6:03 AM) Americans are taking more prescription drugs than ever before, according to a new study that finds almost three in five take at least one medication. Researchers surveyed 38,000 adults aged 20 and older, then estimated that 59% of Americans took prescription drugs as of 2012, compared to 51% in 1999. They also found those on five or more medications rose from 8% to 15%, reports Newsweek. Why the jump? Scientists note the 65-and-older population is growing, with 40% of those in this group taking five or more meds. However, the number of people taking at least five meds rose across all ages. Researchers say part of the reason is likely obesity, noting eight of the 10 most commonly used drugs treat conditions like hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes, per the Washington Post. There's also better screening and diagnosis, but the possibility of medications being overprescribed remains, reports Time. Researchers say the use of drugs to treat high blood pressure jumped from 20% to 27%, while the use of statins, which lower cholesterol, rose from 2% to almost 8%. The most commonly used drug, taken by 8% of Americans, was simvastatin, which lowers cholesterol and the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The use of antidepressants also grew from 7% to 13%, a change scientists link to  shifting attitudes regarding depression,  while the use of narcotics rose 2%. Still, some prescription drugs are being used less.

This information suggests that a significant number of athletes are able to evade detection for their use of banned substances. Pound further emphasizes that those who have prepared in advance and used drugs before the London Olympics are unlikely to get caught. He states that if an athlete gets caught, they fail two tests - a drug test and an IQ test. Pound also mentions that testers are constantly playing catch-up with athletes using new drugs, indicating the challenges faced in detecting these substances. Based on this information, we can infer that the percentage of athletes who get away with using banned substances is 90%. 

To derive this answer, we can follow these numerical reasoning steps:
1. Pound warns that close to a tenth of Olympic athletes are using banned substances, which can be interpreted as approximately 10%.
2. He further states that only one in ten of those athletes are getting caught, which means that 1 out of 10 athletes who use banned substances are detected.
3. To calculate the percentage of athletes who get away with it, we can subtract the percentage of athletes who are caught from the total percentage of athletes using banned substances. 
   Calculation: 10% - 1% = 9%

The sentence also mentions that more than 70 employees will lose their jobs in the shakeup, further supporting the fact that two divisions are being closed. Therefore, the numerical reasoning steps are as follows: 

1. Identify the relevant information: Warner Bros. is closing indie divisions.
2. Determine the number of indie divisions being closed: The news explicitly states that Warner Bros. is closing both Warner Independent Pictures and Picturehouse.
3. Count the number of divisions mentioned: Two divisions are mentioned, Warner Independent Pictures and Picturehouse.
4. Conclude the answer: Based on the information provided, Warner Bros. is closing two indie divisions.

"(Dec 14, 2012  6:29 AM) Legally, Stephen Colbert doesn't have to tell you what happened to the funds his super PAC raised, but last night he went ahead and did so anyway. Turns out the $773,704.83 was  anonymously  donated to the Ham Rove Memorial Fund, of which Colbert is, of course, a board member. (Ham Rove—a ham wearing Karl Rove-like glasses—was the super PAC's  chief strategist and principal lunch meat,  but sadly he came to an untimely end last month.) The Memorial Fund, in turn, decided to split up the money between a few deserving charities. Three charities helping victims of superstorm Sandy are getting $125,000 each; another $125,000 is going to the Yellow Ribbon Fund, which helps injured service members. The rest of the money is being divided between two groups fighting for transparency in politics and campaign finance reform: the Center for Responsive Politics and the Campaign Legal Center. Of course, now the Center for Responsive Politics has a conference room named  The Colbert Super PAC Memorial Conference Room,  and the Campaign Legal Center has one called  The Ham Rove Memorial Conference Room.",Colbert: How I Spent $____K in Super PAC Cash,"Round(Paraphrase(773,704.83,K),0)",773,The news was published on 14th December in the year of 2012.,"To derive the answer of 773, we need to analyze the relevant sentences in the news article. The article states that Stephen Colbert's super PAC raised a total of $773,704.83. It then goes on to mention that this amount was anonymously donated to the Ham Rove Memorial Fund, of which Colbert is a board member. The article further states that the Memorial Fund decided to split up the money between various charities, with three charities receiving $125,000 each, and the Yellow Ribbon Fund receiving another $125,000. The remaining amount is then divided between two groups fighting for transparency in politics and campaign finance reform.

To calculate how much Colbert spent in super PAC cash, we need to subtract the amounts donated to the charities and the two groups from the total raised. The total amount donated to the charities is $125,000 multiplied by 3, which equals $375,000. The amount donated to the Yellow Ribbon Fund is an additional $125,000. Therefore, the total amount donated to the charities and the Yellow Ribbon Fund is $375,000 + $125,000 = $500,000.

To find out how much Colbert spent, we subtract the amount donated to the charities and the Yellow Ribbon Fund from the total raised. Thus, $773,704.83 - $500,000 = $273,704.83.

Therefore, Colbert spent $273,704.83 in super PAC cash. Rounding this amount to the nearest thousand gives us $273,000. So the answer is 773.","The news was published on 14th December in the year of 2012.

However, she argues that this amount is not enough, as her husband amassed the bulk of his fortune during their 26-year marriage.

This sentence provides the specific date on which Pope John Paul II will be declared a saint. To determine the number of months until that date, we need to calculate the difference between the given date of the news article, which is September 30, 2013, and the date of the canonization, which is April 27, 2014. 

To calculate the number of months, we can subtract the month of the news article date from the month of the canonization date. In this case, September (9) minus April (4) equals 5. However, since the canonization date is in the future, we need to add 12 months to account for the remaining months in the current year. So, 5 + 12 equals 17.

Next, we subtract the day of the news article date from the day of the canonization date. In this case, 30 minus 27 equals 3. Since the canonization date is in the future, we need to subtract 1 from the result to account for the remaining days in the current month. So, 3 - 1 equals 2.

Finally, we add the number of months and the number of days together. 17 + 2 equals 19. Therefore, in 19 months, it'll be 'Saint John Paul II'.

"(Nov 11, 2009  8:16 AM) Some 2,266 US veterans under 65 died last year because they didn't have health insurance, a team from Harvard Medical School estimates.

To calculate the number of veterans killed by a lack of health insurance per year, we can multiply the daily rate by the number of days in a year. Since there are 365 days in a year, multiplying six deaths per day by 365 gives us 2,190 deaths per year.

"(Jun 23, 2015  4:33 AM CDT) The good news: American financial security jumped 3% this month. The not-so-good news: Three out of 10 of us have nothing saved for a rainy day. This according to Bankrate's June survey, which found that 29% of 1,000 US adults don't have readily available funds in checking, savings, or money market accounts—the highest percentage since Bankrate started keeping tabs on savings five years ago, NBC News notes. The reason is that, while housing prices and stocks have bounced back, household income hasn't grown.  That makes it very difficult for people to ramp up their savings,  says Greg McBride, Bankrate's chief financial analyst. That doesn't bode well for surprise expenses, which a 2014 American Express survey indicates pop up more often than you may think: Nearly half of respondents had an unforeseen expense last year, with car trouble, health care, and home fixes topping the list. Part of the savings problem, McBride says, per MarketWatch:  People don't pay themselves first—they wait until the end of the month to save what's left over and then nothing is left over.  When those unexpected expenses strike, folks are forced to drive up credit card balances and take out high-interest loans. A financial adviser tells MarketWatch that what you don't see can help you and recommends a monthly automatic transfer to a savings account; another adds to keep that account separate from your checking so you're not tempted to take money out of it.

1. Identify the relevant sentence: ""29% of 1,000 US adults don't have readily available funds in checking, savings, or money market accounts.""
2. Note that the sentence states the percentage of US adults who have zero savings.
3. Recognize that the sentence is referring to a sample size of 1,000 US adults.
4. Understand that the percentage mentioned in the sentence represents the proportion of the sample who have zero savings.
5. Calculate the percentage by dividing the number of US adults with zero savings (29% of 1,000) by the total sample size (1,000).
6. Perform the calculation: (29/100) x 1,000 = 290.
7. Conclude that 290 US adults out of the sample of 1,000 have zero savings.
8. Express the answer as a percentage: (290/1,000) x 100 = 29%.

In one of the attacks, an Israeli helicopter fired missiles at a refugee camp, killing at least 12. The Reuters cameraman was later killed by a missile strike while filming in the same area.

Additionally, it mentions that in one of the attacks, an Israeli helicopter fired missiles at a refugee camp, killing at least 12 people.

From this information, we can conclude that the total number of Palestinians killed is at least 20, and the number of Palestinians killed in the attack on the refugee camp is at least 12. Since the cameraman was killed in the same area, we can infer that he is included in the total number of Palestinians killed. Therefore, the number of Palestinians killed in addition to the cameraman is 20 - 12 = 8.

"(Jan 22, 2016  7:05 AM) From Feb. 20 to March 4 of last year, the FBI ran one of the largest child pornography sites on the dark web—a section of the Internet where people usually operate with anonymity—with the goal of using security-cracking software to identify users. Early last year, the site known as Playpen was traced to computers servers located in North Carolina; the FBI in February relocated the site to its own location in Newington, Va. Though the FBI didn't actually upload illicit content to the site, the FBI also didn't attempt to hide 9,000 downloadable images and videos and links to thousands more. The secret operation allowed agents to identify computer addresses for 1,300 of 100,000 users who visited the site over 13 days; 137 have since been charged, reports USA Today. But not everyone is thrilled with how the sting went down. A lawyer for one of the men arrested, a former middle school teacher, likened the move to  flooding a neighborhood with heroin in the hope of snatching an assortment of low-level drug users,  in a court filing requesting charges be dropped. It's not the first time the FBI has used such a ploy. In 2012, it took control of three child porn sites and kept them online to try to identify users. Agents aren't able to prevent the content from being copied and shared elsewhere.

The article states that the FBI ran the site from February 20 to March 4 of the previous year. This gives us a specific time frame for the operation. To calculate the number of weeks, we need to count the number of weeks between these two dates. 

Step 1: Calculate the number of days between February 20 and March 4. 
There are 12 days between these two dates.

Step 2: Convert the number of days to weeks. 
Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide 12 days by 7 to get the number of weeks. 
12 days / 7 days per week = 1.71 weeks

Step 3: Round the number of weeks to the nearest whole number. 
Since we cannot have a fraction of a week, we round 1.71 to the nearest whole number, which is 2.

"(Jun 10, 2016  1:59 PM CDT) In 1995, things were rocky between Maria Mancia and her husband, Valentin Hernandez—and one day after work, Mancia returned to their California apartment to find her husband and their 18-month-old son, Steven, gone, along with all the boy's things. Hernandez took all the photos of Steven, even an ultrasound image, that could be used to identify him; Mancia had to contact family in El Salvador to get the sole picture of her son she's treasured all the years since. She reported the kidnapping to the San Bernardino County sheriff's office, but over the years, she tried to wrap her head around the thought that she might never see him again. Then, last week, detectives came to her house:  They told me they found him. They found Steven,  Mancia, 42, tells the San Bernardino Sun. The 22-year-old Steven was found living in Mexico in February after investigators received a tip, the AP reports. Authorities told him they were investigating Hernandez's father, who had recently disappeared himself, and the background information Steven gave them was similar to that of the missing child they were looking for. Eventually, he was positively identified via DNA, and on Thursday, he reunited with his long-lost mom at the San Bernardino DA's office, wiping tears from her face as they hugged.

To determine the number of years that have passed since Steven was kidnapped, we need to subtract the year of the kidnapping from the year he was found. 

The year of the kidnapping is given as 1995, and the year he was found is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer it from the sentence ""The 22-year-old Steven was found living in Mexico in February."" Since the news article was published in 2016, we can assume that the year he was found is also 2016.

1. The news was published on 17th December in the year 2009.
2. The article mentions that Lieberman may still be sour about not winning the 2004 presidential race.

To find the answer, we subtract the year of the news publication (2009) from the year mentioned in the article (2004). 

2004 - 2009 = -5

Since the result is negative, we take the absolute value to get the year without the negative sign.

These sentences indicate that the teen driver involved in the car accident did not have a valid driver's license. 

To derive the answer, we can use the information provided in the news article. It states that the driver didn't have a valid driver's license and was cited for violating his provisional one. This implies that the driver had a provisional license, which is a type of license issued to new drivers. 

Since the driver didn't have a valid driver's license, it can be inferred that the provisional license was not valid or had been revoked. Therefore, the driver was driving without a license at the time of the accident.

Their passports were confiscated by court order and a US Olympic Committee spokesman tells NBC News that they were released  with the understanding that they would continue their discussions about the incident on Thursday.  Police also want to speak to swimmer Ryan Lochte, who has already returned to the US. The USOC spokesman says a fourth swimmer, Jimmy Feigen, is still in Brazil and is cooperating with authorities.

Revenue also decreased 13%, and the Wall Street Journal notes that the stock price is slipping in pre-market trading. One analyst notes that 2010 compensation marks the second-lowest level in Goldman’s history; its lowest level ever, 36% of revenue, was in 2009—which was just two years after compensation hit an all-time high for Wall Street. Though this year’s figure still sounds high, the analyst notes that  Goldman must balance the need to pay its employees fairly based on their performance along with the public perception of its activities.",Average Goldman Pay for 2010: $____K,"SRound(Paraphrase(430,700,K),0)",430,The news was published on 19th January in the year of 2011.,"To derive the answer of $430K for the average Goldman pay for 2010, we need to analyze the information provided in the news article.

This sentence gives us the average pay for 2011 and the percentage decrease from the previous year. 

Next, the article mentions that the bank's compensation and benefits expense in 2010 was 39% of revenue, which was $15.4 billion. This information allows us to calculate the total revenue for 2010 by dividing the compensation and benefits expense by the percentage of revenue it represents. 

Furthermore, the article states that the compensation and benefits expense in 2010 was 5% lower than the previous year. By applying this percentage decrease to the total revenue for the previous year, we can calculate the total revenue for 2009. 

The article also mentions that the lowest level of compensation for Goldman Sachs, which was 36% of revenue, occurred in 2009. This information allows us to calculate the compensation for 2009 by multiplying the total revenue for 2009 by the percentage of compensation. 

Finally, the article states that the compensation for 2010 marks the second-lowest level in Goldman's history. By comparing the compensation for 2010 with the compensation for 2009, we can determine that the compensation for 2010 is higher than the compensation for 2009.

"(Feb 12, 2018  4:33 AM) The elitist of clubs welcomed a third member on Monday: American figure skater Mirai Nagasu became the third woman to even land a triple axel at the Olympics. You can watch the jump here. It came as part of an effort that saw the US women secure a team bronze, and it places her alongside Midori Ito, who landed the jump in 1992, and Mao Asada, who managed the feat in 2010 and 2014; both were skating for Japan. It's not the first time Nagasu has skated for America, but the 24-year-old's past attempts haven't been so headline-grabbing. She ended up fourth in Vancouver in 2010 and missed out on Sochi in 2014. The Washington Post reports her dream of landing the jump was what brought her back to the ice after that Sochi  snub.  ESPN echos that series of events, and reports it took Nagasu two years to master the jump, which she attempts about 30 times a day in training. Writing for USA Today, Christine Brennan sees the jump as making her a contender for an individual medal (that competition starts Feb. 21), though she notes bets are on Russian skaters Alina Zagitova ( the sport’s new 15-year-old 'it' girl ) and Evgenia Medvedeva taking gold and silver. Slate reports that Ito and Asada both ended up with silver after their own triple axels. As for the team competition, Canada took gold and Olympic Athletes from Russia took silver. The Post notes only one other American woman has landed a triple axel in competition: Tonya Harding did so at the 1991 world championships. Brian Orser was the first to ever land a triple axel at the games, in Sarajevo in 1984.",US Skater Just Did What Only ____ Others Have,"Add(Span(Midori Ito),Span(Mao Asada))",2,The news was published on 12th February in the year of 2018.,"To derive the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question, we need to analyze the relevant sentences in the given news article. The article states that Mirai Nagasu became the third woman to land a triple axel at the Olympics, joining Midori Ito and Mao Asada. It also mentions that Tonya Harding, an American skater, landed a triple axel at the 1991 world championships. From this information, we can conclude that Nagasu is the second American woman to achieve this feat. 

Numerical Reasoning Steps:
1. Identify the relevant information: The article mentions that Nagasu is the third woman to land a triple axel at the Olympics, and Tonya Harding landed a triple axel at the 1991 world championships.
2. Determine the number of women who have landed a triple axel at the Olympics: The article states that Nagasu is the third woman to achieve this at the Olympics, so there are two other women who have done so.
3. Determine the number of American women who have landed a triple axel: The article mentions that Tonya Harding landed a triple axel at the 1991 world championships, indicating that she is the only other American woman to achieve this.
4. Combine the information: Since Nagasu is the third woman to land a triple axel at the Olympics and Tonya Harding is the only other American woman to achieve this, we can conclude that Nagasu is the second American woman to do so.

The article states that a New York family sold a Chinese bowl for $2,224,997 more than they paid for it, which was $3. So, the difference in the selling price and the purchase price is $2,224,997. The article also mentions that Sotheby's had anticipated the bowl to sell for up to $300,000. However, it ended up selling for much more than that. Therefore, the selling price of the bowl must be higher than $300,000. Combining these pieces of information, we can conclude that the selling price of the bowl is $2,224,997 + $300,000 = $2,524,997.

"(May 3, 2016  8:57 AM CDT) At least 23 people are reported dead after an unapproved building collapsed Friday in Nairobi, Kenya, per the Star, but the Kenya Red Cross offered a bit of hope early Tuesday.  Good news! A child aged about one and half years rescued alive at 0400 hours,  the organization tweeted, adding in a press release that the baby had been found 80 hours after the collapse nestled in a bucket and wrapped in a blanket. Although the child, IDed as Dealeryn Saisi Wasike by the BBC (which also says she's only 6 months old), seemed dehydrated, there were no other immediate signs of injury, and she's now recuperating at a nearby hospital. The Red Cross' Twitter feed also indicates the baby has been reunited with her dad, though the group says it hasn't confirmed what happened to her mother, per Reuters. Media reports differ, but estimates hover at around 140 rescued so far and almost 100 still missing after the six-story building slated for demolition in the Huruma district crumbled after heavy rains Friday. At least five people are due in court Tuesday to face manslaughter charges, including a city inspection official, a rep from the nation's construction agency, the building's engineer, and two brothers who own the site. The owners didn't have permission to rent the building out, and it was apparently never approved by the city. That last point doesn't appear to be an anomaly: Nairobi's deputy governor tells Nairobi News that up to 70% of residential buildings don't have formal approval from City Hall.

"(Apr 30, 2015  7:19 AM CDT) Another estimated 100 children and 60 women were rescued from Boko Haram yesterday, just a day after another rescue operation freed nearly 300.

Troops are now working to destroy militant camps—they've hit nine so far—in the forest.  Many of those kidnapped have undergone psychological trauma and indoctrination,  says an army spokesman—and indeed, some of the 293 women and girls rescued earlier in the week had been so indoctrinated by Boko Haram, they actually opened fire on their rescuers, the AP reports.

The news states that ""Another estimated 100 children and 60 women were rescued from Boko Haram yesterday, just a day after another rescue operation freed nearly 300."" This sentence tells us that a total of 160 women and girls were rescued in the recent operation. 

To arrive at this answer, we can break down the sentence into two parts: the rescue of children and the rescue of women. The news mentions that 100 children were rescued, so we can subtract this number from the total of 160 to find the number of women rescued. 

160 - 100 = 60

Therefore, 60 women were rescued. 

So the answer is 160, with 60 being the number of women rescued from Boko Haram.","The news was published on 30th April in the year of 2015.

"(Jan 29, 2019  8:45 AM) Asia Bibi is finally free to leave Pakistan, if she hasn't already. On Tuesday, the country's Supreme Court upheld its own acquittal of Bibi—a Christian mother first arrested a decade ago on blasphemy charges and sentenced to death in 2010—rejecting a challenge to its earlier decision and streamlining the path for Bibi to flee, which many expect her to do, the Guardian reports. Bibi got into a disagreement with farmworkers in 2009 and was accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad, but the Supreme Court ruled in October that the evidence used against her was weak, and that her supposed confession was made under duress. The court's decision to reverse her original conviction was met with nationwide violence prompted by Islamic radicals, and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan apparently gave in to their demands, allowing an appeal to be submitted on the court's decision. Christians worldwide, including Pope Francis, had lobbied for her release, CNN notes.  The image of Islam we are showing to the world gives me much grief and sorrow,  Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa said Tuesday as the three-judge committee rejected the appeal, adding that Bibi's accusers should've been jailed for perjury, per the AP. Bibi—who the BBC notes was required to stay in Pakistan while the petition was pending—has had to remain in hiding since her release last fall, with extremists threatening to kill her even if the Supreme Court kept her acquittal intact.  She deserves to be murdered, according to Sharia,  one Islamic radical tells AFP.  If she goes out of Pakistan ... anybody can kill her.  Two of Bibi's daughters are said to be in Canada, and it's expected she may seek asylum there; PM Justin Trudeau has previously said his government would be willing to help her out.","For ____nd Time, High Court Frees Christian Sentenced to Die","Add(Span(the country's Supreme Court upheld its own acquittal),Span(The court's decision to reverse her))",2,The news was published on 29th January in the year of 2019.,"The relevant sentences in the news article are: ""Asia Bibi is finally free to leave Pakistan, if she hasn't already"" and ""For ____nd Time, High Court Frees Christian Sentenced to Die."" These sentences suggest that Asia Bibi has been freed by the High Court for the second time. To derive the answer of 2, we can follow these numerical reasoning steps: 

1. The news article mentions that Asia Bibi was first sentenced to death in 2010, but her conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court in October.
2. The article also states that the Supreme Court upheld its own acquittal of Bibi, rejecting a challenge to its earlier decision.
3. Since the Supreme Court's decision to reverse her original conviction was met with nationwide violence, it can be inferred that this was the first time she was freed.
4. The phrase ""For ____nd Time"" in the sentence indicates that this is the second time the High Court has freed a Christian sentenced to die.

Step 2: Subtract the start time from the end time. 01:30 - 17:00 = -15:30.
Step 3: Since we cannot have a negative duration, we add 24 hours to the result. -15:30 + 24:00 = 8:30.
Step 4: Convert the result back to a 12-hour format. 8:30 becomes 8 hours and 30 minutes.

Now charged with murder, Pilkington, 23, admitted to smothering Noah with a blanket, along with two other sons over 13 months, because her husband Joseph, 43—who'd had a previous relationship with her mom—paid more attention to them than to their daughter, whom she called her best friend, police tell the Dayton Daily News.

People called her crazy and a hoarder, especially because she slept in shelters or on the streets. But when a social worker began looking into the case last year, she concluded Witter was correct, reports the Washington Post. That social worker got an attorney to investigate, and this week, the feds deposited $99,999 into Witter's bank account. She may be getting more.  I wasn’t crazy,  says Witter. The Post first covered Witter's 16-year predicament last week. She began collecting Social Security in 2006, but the check amounts varied wildly from month to month. Knowing something was wrong, she refused to cash them and instead returned them with the word  void  written across the front. In the meantime, she ran out of money and ended up homeless.

To derive the answer, we can start by noting that the social worker concluded that Witter was correct, indicating that the government owed her money. The next sentence states that the feds deposited $99,999 into Witter's bank account. This suggests that the amount deposited is less than what she was owed, as it is not specified that the full amount was deposited. Finally, the sentence ends with ""She may be getting more,"" implying that there is a possibility of receiving additional funds.

Based on this information, we can infer that the amount owed to Witter is at least $100,000, as the deposited amount is less than what she was owed and there is a possibility of receiving more. Therefore, the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question is $100K (100,000). So the answer is 100.","The news was published on 28th August in the year of 2016.

The grandfather, father, Scarlett Smith's 5-year-old twin, and a 10-year-old sister survived the crash with minor injuries, Boston.com reports. A pickup truck rear-ended the family's rental van at full speed when the van slowed down due to congestion, rolling it over, the Boston Globe reports. Two other vehicles were also struck, but no one else was injured. Everyone in the van except the father, who survived, was wearing a seatbelt or child restraint. The 26-year-old driver of the pickup, whom police say was  distraught  and voluntarily provided a blood sample for drug and alcohol testing, may be charged, but police don't believe impairment was a factor.

The news article states that the family consisted of Grandma Josephine Fay, mom Julie Smith, daughter Scarlett Smith, son Jackson Smith, the grandfather, the father, Scarlett Smith's 5-year-old twin, and a 10-year-old sister.

"(Aug 8, 2012  9:30 AM CDT) Egypt launched its first air attacks in the Sinai Peninsula in nearly four decades in the early hours of today, using helicopters to kill suspected militants close to the border, reports the New York Times. State media puts the toll at 20. The airstrikes came after another assault on at least seven government checkpoints and a military cement factory late last night, and follow Sunday's attack, which killed 16 Egyptian police officers. In a televised statement, the military announced the start of the joint military-police ground operation, backed by warplanes, to  restore stability and regain control  of the area, reports the AP. With the Muslim Brotherhood's strong ties to Hamas, the violence is further inflaming Egypt's divisions between supporters of the secular, military regime and Islamists. Yesterday, Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi canceled his plans to attend the funeral for the officers killed on Sunday. Prime Minister Hesham Qandil attempted to attend an earlier prayer service, but was chased by shoe-wielding protesters blaming the Muslim Brotherhood for the deaths (Qandil is not a member of the Brotherhood).",Egypt Fires Missiles in Sinai for 1st Time Since ____,"Subtract(2012,Multiply(Trans(four),10))",1973,The news was published on 8th August in the year of 2012.,"The relevant sentence in the news article states, ""Egypt launched its first air attacks in the Sinai Peninsula in nearly four decades in the early hours of today.""

Police say someone stole 19 cases of the Italian cheese from the Do Drop Inn in Pueblo early Tuesday, the AP reports. The restaurant doors were damaged and restaurant manager Kevin Romero tells the Pueblo Chieftain that the thief broke through padlocks on a restaurant freezer to get to the cheese, which is worth around $1,900. Nothing else was taken. Per a police report, clues left at the scene included a crowbar and other  biological evidence.  Romero says this is at least the third time cheese has been stolen from the restaurant, presumably to be sold to other eateries, in the last month and a half. However, this time the thief's image was captured by security cameras the restaurant recently installed.  The first time they came in they stole about probably five or six boxes,  Romero tells KOAA about the increasingly brazen crimes.  The second time was eight to 10 boxes, and now the 19 boxes. I don't get it. There must be some black market for cheese that I don't know about.  One regular customer who's either particularly perturbed or simply wanted to make a rodent-themed joke tells the station,  I hope they catch the dirty rats.  (Mozzarella is better for pizza anyway.)",'Provolone Poacher' Lifts $____K in Cheese from Restaurant,"Round(Paraphrase(1,900,K),0)",2,The news was published on 7th April in the year of 2016.,"To derive the answer, we need to analyze the relevant sentences in the news article. The article states that the thief stole 19 cases of provolone cheese from the Do Drop Inn in Pueblo. It also mentions that the cheese is worth around $1,900. From this information, we can deduce that each case of provolone cheese is worth approximately $100 (1900 divided by 19). 

Now, the article also mentions that this is at least the third time cheese has been stolen from the restaurant in the last month and a half. The first time, the thief stole about five or six boxes, and the second time, it was eight to ten boxes. However, this time, the thief stole 19 boxes. 

Based on this information, we can infer that the number of boxes stolen is increasing with each incident. Assuming a linear progression, we can calculate the average increase in the number of boxes stolen. 

For the first incident, the thief stole 5 or 6 boxes, so let's take the average and assume it was 5.5 boxes. For the second incident, the thief stole 8 to 10 boxes, so let's take the average and assume it was 9 boxes. 

The difference between the first and second incidents is 9 - 5.5 = 3.5 boxes. 

Now, to find the average increase, we divide this difference by the number of incidents: 3.5 / 2 = 1.75 boxes. 

So, if the average increase is 1.75 boxes, and the thief stole 19 boxes this time, we can estimate that the thief stole 19 - 1.75 = 17.25 boxes in the previous incident. 

Finally, multiplying the estimated number of boxes by the value of each case ($100), we can calculate the value of the cheese stolen in the previous incident: 17.25 * 100 = $1,725. 

Therefore, the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question is $1.725K, which is equivalent to $1,725,000. 

So the answer is $1.725K.","The news was published on 7th April in the year of 2016.

"(Sep 29, 2008  8:38 AM CDT) The European tour group kidnapped in Egypt more than a week ago has been freed, according to official reports, after a gun battle between Sudanese troops and the kidnappers. Sudanese officials said yesterday that they’d killed the leader of the kidnappers and five other bandits in a shootout. Though the hostages were being held elsewhere, the kidnappers suddenly agreed to release them. The kidnappers were demanding a 6-million-Euro ransom for the group, which includes 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides. A deal was in place to pay that ransom, but after the battle the kidnappers agreed to release the prisoners gratis, an Egyptian security official said.  The problem was solved. They had agreed to the ransom. It was merely a matter of receiving the hostages, but then this surprise happened.","Egypt Frees ____ Tourists, Kills Kidnappers","Add(11,Trans(eight))",19,The news was published on 29th September in the year of 2008.,"The relevant sentences in the news article are: ""The European tour group kidnapped in Egypt more than a week ago has been freed, according to official reports, after a gun battle between Sudanese troops and the kidnappers."" and ""The kidnappers were demanding a 6-million-Euro ransom for the group, which includes 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides.""

"(Aug 17, 2009  2:16 PM CDT) In 1959, Miles Davis was looking to forge a path away from the bebop spearheaded by mentor Charlie Parker, Fred Kaplan writes on Slate.  Parker not only invented bebop, he perfected it,  Kaplan continues, leaving Davis nowhere else to go. So when Davis was introduced to so-called  modal  jazz—with the emphasis on free experimentation with scales and away from rigid chord structures—he jumped at it.  Man, if Bird was alive, this would kill him,  Davis said. Before he recorded  the best-selling jazz album of all time and the spearhead of an artistic revolution,  Davis needed a pianist  who knew how to accompany without playing chords.  Which was crazy, Kaplan writes, because playing chords  was what modern jazz pianists did.  But with Bill Evans and hornsmen John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley, a legend was born. The tunes have  the same feel as the other blues tunes,  Kaplan concludes, but  there are no chord changes.

This sentence provides the context for the question and indicates that the news article was published in 2009. 

To determine the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question, we need to calculate the number of years that have passed since the publication of the news article until the present day. 

First, we subtract the publication year (2009) from the current year. As the current year is not provided, we will assume it is the year in which this question is being answered. Let's assume the current year is 2021. 

2021 - 2009 = 12

Next, we need to consider that the news article was published on August 17th. Since we don't have the exact date of the current day, we will assume it is after August 17th. 

If the current day is after August 17th, we add 1 to the result. If the current day is before August 17th, we don't add anything. 

Assuming the current day is September 1st, we add 1 to the result.

"(Jul 25, 2011  12:15 PM CDT) Racy text-messaging is simply a part of college life, a study suggests: Some 78% of 200 students in a University of Rhode Island survey say they’ve received sexts, and 56% have gotten sexts containing pictures, Time reports. Most of these messages, it should be noted—about 73%—weren’t just random: they were sent to a romantic partner. However, a fifth of sext recipients went right ahead and forwarded the message to someone else, and 10% of sexts were passed on without the original sender’s approval. So why the heavy sexting?  At the age of most college students, people are filtering through relationships at a faster rate,  says a study author.

But there's a serious side, Time notes: Some students are 17, and they live in a state where it recently became illegal for minors to sext.",____ in 5 College Kids Sext,"Round(Multiply(5,78%),0)",4,The news was published on 25th July in the year of 2011.,"To derive the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question, we need to analyze the relevant information provided in the news article. According to the article, 78% of the 200 students surveyed at the University of Rhode Island reported receiving sexts. This means that out of the 200 students, 78% or 0.78 * 200 = 156 students have received sexts. Additionally, 56% of the surveyed students reported receiving sexts containing pictures. Therefore, 0.56 * 200 = 112 students have received sexts with pictures. 

The article also mentions that most of these messages, about 73%, were sent to a romantic partner. This implies that 73% of the students who received sexts, or 0.73 * 156 = 113.88 students, received sexts from a romantic partner. 

However, a fifth of the sext recipients forwarded the message to someone else, which means 20% of the students who received sexts, or 0.20 * 156 = 31.2 students, forwarded the messages. Additionally, 10% of the sexts were passed on without the original sender's approval. This means that 10% of the students who received sexts, or 0.10 * 156 = 15.6 students, passed on the messages without approval.

To determine the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question, we need to find the fraction of students who forwarded or passed on the sexts. Adding the number of students who forwarded the messages (31.2) and the number of students who passed on the messages without approval (15.6), we get a total of 31.2 + 15.6 = 46.8 students. 

Therefore, the fraction of students who forwarded or passed on the sexts is 46.8/156 = 0.3. This can be expressed as 3/10 or 30%. 

So the answer is 4, as 30% can be simplified to 3/10, which means that 3 out of 10 college kids sext.","The news was published on 25th July in the year of 2011.

"(Aug 1, 2014  12:37 AM CDT) On the day before the 9/11 attacks, Bill Clinton spoke openly about having passed up a chance to kill Osama bin Laden, according to a tape unearthed by Sky News Australia.  I'm just saying, you know, if I were Osama bin Laden—he's a very smart guy, I've spent a lot of time thinking about him—and I nearly got him once,  Clinton says on the tape.  I nearly got him. And I could have killed him, but I would have to destroy a little town called Kandahar in Afghanistan and kill 300 innocent women and children, and then I would have been no better than him. And so I didn't do it.  When the recording was made, just 10 hours before the first plane hit the World Trade Center, Clinton was speaking to a group of business leaders in Melbourne, NBC reports. The talk was reportedly recorded with Clinton's permission, and the tape surfaced this week after one of the business leaders at the lunch remembered he had it. The 9/11 Commission found that the Clinton administration decided against a strike in Kandahar in late 1998, reports the New York Daily News, which notes that Kandahar isn't a  little town  but a city of more than 400,000 people—and one that is now very familiar to US troops.","On ____, Clinton Said He Could Have Killed bin Laden","Subtract(9/11,Span(On the day before))",9/10,The news was published on 1st August in the year of 2014.,"The relevant sentences in the news article are: ""When the recording was made, just 10 hours before the first plane hit the World Trade Center, Clinton was speaking to a group of business leaders in Melbourne"" and ""The 9/11 Commission found that the Clinton administration decided against a strike in Kandahar in late 1998."" 

To derive the answer, we need to determine the date when Clinton made the statement about being able to kill bin Laden. We know that the recording was made 10 hours before the first plane hit the World Trade Center, which occurred on September 11th. Therefore, we can subtract 10 hours from September 11th to find the date when the recording was made. 

Step 1: Convert 10 hours to days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 10 hours is equal to 10/24 or 0.4167 days. 

Step 2: Subtract 0.4167 days from September 11th. 

September 11th - 0.4167 days = September 10th (rounded to the nearest day).

"(Nov 15, 2019  8:12 AM) Look out, Florida, Indiana is coming for your  Land of Weird Crimes  title: NPR reports three judges there have now been suspended without pay after a May 1 incident that saw them act  in an injudicious manner,  per a Tuesday decision from the Indiana Supreme Court. Per the ruling, Andrew Adams, Bradley Jacobs, and Sabrina Bell went out for a night of drinking in Indianapolis the night before a judicial conference; at around 3am, they walked to a strip club, which was closed. Their next stop: a White Castle, where Bell gave the finger to Alfredo Vazquez and Brandon Kaiser, who were driving by. Vasquez and Kaiser pulled over, the four men scuffled, and then Kaiser allegedly drew a gun and shot Adams and Jacobs; they were both seriously wounded and deemed intoxicated after blood tests. In her police statement, Bell noted she and the other judges are  very good friends  and that she's  fiery  and  fiesty  and tends to get  mouthy  when she drinks.  They're very protective of me,  she said of Adams and Jacobs. Jacobs and Bell have both been suspended for 30 days, while Adams is suspended for 60. He pleaded guilty in September to a charge of misdemeanor battery and was sentenced to a year in jail but only had to serve two days. Per the Indianapolis Star, both Adams and Jacobs issued statements of apology, noting how they'd embarrassed the judiciary, their families, and their communities. NBC News notes that Kaiser will face a slew of charges at his January trial, including battery with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct, while Vasquez, his nephew, already pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery earlier this month; he received 180 days of home detention and a year of probation.","Judges' Visit to White Castle Ends With Fight, ____ Shot","Add(Span(Adams),Span(Jacobs))",2,The news was published on 15th November in the year of 2019.,"The relevant sentences in the news article are: ""Kaiser allegedly drew a gun and shot Adams and Jacobs; they were both seriously wounded and deemed intoxicated after blood tests.""

News: Look out, Florida, Indiana is coming for your  Land of Weird Crimes  title: NPR reports three judges there have now been suspended without pay after a May 1 incident that saw them act  in an injudicious manner,  per a Tuesday decision from the Indiana Supreme Court. Per the ruling, Andrew Adams, Bradley Jacobs, and Sabrina Bell went out for a night of drinking in Indianapolis the night before a judicial conference; at around 3am, they walked to a strip club, which was closed. Their next stop: a White Castle, where Bell gave the finger to Alfredo Vazquez and Brandon Kaiser, who were driving by. Vasquez and Kaiser pulled over, the four men scuffled, and then Kaiser allegedly drew a gun and shot Adams and Jacobs; they were both seriously wounded and deemed intoxicated after blood tests. In her police statement, Bell noted she and the other judges are  very good friends  and that she's  fiery  and  fiesty  and tends to get  mouthy  when she drinks.  They're very protective of me,  she said of Adams and Jacobs. Jacobs and Bell have both been suspended for 30 days, while Adams is suspended for 60. He pleaded guilty in September to a charge of misdemeanor battery and was sentenced to a year in jail but only had to serve two days. Per the Indianapolis Star, both Adams and Jacobs issued statements of apology, noting how they'd embarrassed the judiciary, their families, and their communities. NBC News notes that Kaiser will face a slew of charges at his January trial, including battery with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct, while Vasquez, his nephew, already pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery earlier this month; he received 180 days of home detention and a year of probation.

"(Dec 11, 2013  6:57 AM) Canadian researchers have detected another greenhouse gas—and its global warming potential is extreme. Over the course of a century,  a single molecule of PFTBA has the equivalent climate impact as 7,100 molecules of CO2,  says a lead author of the study that identified perfluorotributylamine.  We claim that PFTBA has the highest radiative efficiency of any molecule detected in the atmosphere to date,  Angela Hong adds. Electrical items, including transistors and capacitors, have used PFTBA since the middle of the last century, the Guardian reports, though its impact on climate was only now established. And like certain other industrial chemicals,  it is not being regulated by any type of climate policy,  says Hong. The study's silver lining: The researchers found that compared to carbon dioxide, there's relatively little of the stuff in the atmosphere: 0.18 parts per trillion around Toronto, where the study was conducted, versus 400 parts per million of CO2. But while trees and oceans act as carbon sinks, researchers say no one knows how to rid the atmosphere of the chemical, AFP notes, which could stick around for as long as 500 years.

This sentence provides the necessary information to determine the factor by which PFTBA is worse than CO2. To derive the answer, we need to calculate the ratio of the climate impact of PFTBA to that of CO2. Since the impact of a single molecule of PFTBA is equivalent to 7,100 molecules of CO2, we can express this as a ratio: 1 molecule of PFTBA / 7,100 molecules of CO2. To simplify this ratio, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 1 to get: 1/1 molecule of PFTBA / 7,100/1 molecules of CO2. This simplifies to 1/7,100 molecule of PFTBA / 1 molecule of CO2. Therefore, the ratio of the climate impact of PFTBA to CO2 is 1/7,100. To express this ratio in terms of how much worse PFTBA is than CO2, we can take the reciprocal of the ratio: 7,100/1. So the answer is 7.","The news was published on 11th December in the year of 2013. News: Canadian researchers have detected another greenhouse gas—and its global warming potential is extreme.

The anonymous survey of 10,000 men and 3,000 women in Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka—home to more than half the global population—found 25% of men had raped their partner, while 10% raped another woman at least once, the Guardian reports.

And since more than half committed rape as a teenager, it  highlights the need to start working with younger boys and girls to stop the violence,  she said. Options include changing social norms, cutting down on childhood violence, and prosecuting rapists.

To derive the answer, we can start by noting that the 8.3 million homeowners mentioned in the article represent the number of homeowners who owe more to their lenders than their homes are worth. This number is given as a percentage of the total number of homeowners in the United States. 

To find the total number of homeowners, we can use the information that 20% of Americans with home mortgages are underwater. If we assume that all homeowners in the United States have a mortgage, then we can calculate the total number of homeowners by dividing the 8.3 million homeowners by 20% (or 0.20). 

Mathematically, this can be represented as: 
Total number of homeowners = 8.3 million / 0.20 = 41.5 million

There was also the trivial matter of $79,600 in cash, which the Prince George's county executive instructed his wife to hide in her skivvies.  I have it in my bra,  she told him, before letting the agents in—agents who had an odd premonition that she might be hiding $79,600 in her bra, reports the Washington Post. Both Johnsons have been charged with witness tampering and destruction of evidence. The Post notes that bribery charges are likely. Fill in the blank: Politician's Wife Busted With $____K in Bra"
"(Apr 3, 2010  4:46 PM CDT) Two adults and three juveniles have been charged with gang raping a 7-year-old girl who was sold by her 15-year-old stepsister during a party at a crime-ridden apartment building in Trenton, NJ. Prior to today's announcement of new arrests, the 15-year-old had been charged with promoting prostitution.

"(Apr 27, 2018  1:48 AM CDT) Former NBC and Fox anchor Linda Vester say she suffered  years of humiliation and isolation  after being sexually harassed by powerful colleague Tom Brokaw in the 1990s. Vester tells Variety that when Brokaw was the host of NBC Nightly News, he made unwanted advances and tried to forcibly kiss her on two occasions, telling her he was looking  for an affair of more than passing affection.  She says Brokaw, who is 30 years her senior, turned up uninvited at her hotel room in 1994, when she was 28, and at her residence in London the next year. Vester, a former war correspondent, says the behavior of her married colleague was  coercive and disgusting.  This is the first time Brokaw has been publicly accused of sexual harassment. Vester says she didn't report Brokaw's misconduct because there is a culture at NBC  where women who raise questions about misconduct get labeled as troublemakers  and she feared for her job, having just been hired full-time. Brokaw, who has been married to Meredith Auld since 1962, says he met with Vester twice at her request because she wanted career advice.  The meetings were brief, cordial, and appropriate, and despite Linda’s allegations, I made no romantic overtures towards her, at that time or any other,  he said in a statement issued by NBC.

These sentences provide the percentages of veterans who believe the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were worth it.

To do this, we add the percentage of veterans who say yes (34%) to the percentage of veterans who say no (33%). This gives us a total of 67%. 

Next, we need to determine the fraction or ratio of veterans who say yes. To do this, we divide the percentage of veterans who say yes (34%) by the total percentage (67%). 

Calculating 34% divided by 67% gives us approximately 0.507.

The US is  virtually alone in its willingness to sentence non-violent offenders to die behind bars,  says report author Jennifer Turner. The ACLU wants life sentences abolished for these types of criminals because they are  grotesquely out of proportion to the conduct they seek to punish.

The article also mentions that most of these prisoners are black men convicted of drug crimes. 

To derive the answer, we need to determine the number of prisoners serving life sentences for non-violent crimes. The given number of 3,278 represents the total number of prisoners serving life sentences for all types of crimes. However, we are only interested in the subset of prisoners serving life sentences for non-violent crimes. 

Since the article does not provide the exact number of prisoners serving life sentences for non-violent crimes, we can estimate this number by considering the statement that most of these prisoners are black men convicted of drug crimes. This suggests that the majority of the 3,278 prisoners are serving life sentences for drug-related offenses. 

To estimate the number, we can assume that ""most"" means more than half, so let's take 60% as a conservative estimate. Therefore, we can calculate 60% of 3,278 to find the estimated number of prisoners serving life sentences for non-violent drug crimes. 

60% of 3,278 = 0.60 * 3,278 = 1,966.8

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get an estimated 1,967 prisoners serving life sentences for non-violent drug crimes.

"(Jun 17, 2015  10:06 AM CDT) American women are having more babies after years of holding off since the beginning of the recession in 2007. The US birth rate saw a small 1% jump from 2013 to 2014, with 3.98 million births—the highest number since 2010, USA Today reports. The CDC data shows older women are largely responsible, with births among women in their 30s up 3%; births among women in their 40s rose 2%, reports the Verge. Why now?  The recession is ending—we think it's ending—for some people, so we might attribute a rise in the birth rate  to the economy, says a demographer.  I think as people feel their paycheck is more stable, it feels like a safe environment to have a child in,  a researcher adds. The teen birth rate continues to decline, falling to a historic low of 249,067 births last year. That's a 9% drop from 2013, when 305,000 teen moms gave birth. The birth rate among women 15 to 19 has now fallen by 60% over 25 years. The study author called the result  amazing.  Still,  there remains room for improvement to help teens be in charge of their own fertility and only get pregnant when they wish to get pregnant,  a researcher says. The birth rate among single young women also fell, alongside a 2% drop among women in their 20s. As the data was gathered from US birth certificates, women's decisions for having children weren't considered. (This country now has the world's lowest birth rate.)","After ____-Year Slide, US Birth Rate Rebounds","Subtract(Subtract(2015,2007),1)",7,The news was published on 17th June in the year of 2015.,"The relevant sentences in the news article are: ""The US birth rate saw a small 1% jump from 2013 to 2014, with 3.98 million births—the highest number since 2010"" and ""The birth rate among women 15 to 19 has now fallen by 60% over 25 years."" 

To derive the answer, we need to calculate the number of years it took for the birth rate to rebound from the lowest point to the highest point. 

First, we need to find the lowest point of the birth rate, which is mentioned as the ""60% drop over 25 years"" among women aged 15 to 19. To find the lowest point, we divide the current birth rate by 0.4 (100% - 60% = 40%). 

Let's assume the lowest birth rate was X. So, X / 0.4 = 249,067 births. Solving for X, we get X = 99,626.8 births. 

Next, we need to find the difference between the lowest point and the highest point, which is mentioned as a 1% jump from 2013 to 2014. The difference is 3.98 million births - 99,626.8 births = 3,880,373.2 births. 

Now, we need to find the number of years it took for the birth rate to rebound by dividing the difference by the annual increase. So, 3,880,373.2 births / 0.01 = 388,037,320 years. 

Therefore, the answer is 7 years, as the birth rate rebounded after a 7-year slide.","The news was published on 17th June in the year of 2015.

The birth rate among women 15 to 19 has now fallen by 60% over 25 years. The study author called the result  amazing.  Still,  there remains room for improvement to help teens be in charge of their own fertility and only get pregnant when they wish to get pregnant,  a researcher says. The birth rate among single young women also fell, alongside a 2% drop among women in their 20s. As the data was gathered from US birth certificates, women's decisions for having children weren't considered. The news was published on 17th June in the year of 2015.

"(May 19, 2016  7:00 AM CDT) The Securities and Exchange Commission is filing a complaint against professional golfer Phil Mickelson related to insider trading, the AP reports. The SEC says gambler William Walters received tips and business information about Dean Foods Co. from Thomas Davis, former head of Dean Foods, between 2008 and 2012. The SEC says Walters called Mickelson, who owed him money, in 2012 and urged him to trade Dean Foods stock. The SEC says Mickelson did so the next day, buying 240,000 shares and making a profit of $931,000, per ESPN. He then used that money to pay Walters back his IOU a few months later, the SEC says. Mickelson's attorney told ESPN on Thursday that the golfer, who wasn't charged criminally, has made a deal with the SEC that involves him returning all money made from that trade—what the SEC refers to as  all ill-gotten gains in the form of illicit trading profits,  per USA Today. Mickelson was not in the field at the AT&T Byron Nelson tournament in Irving, Texas, where play began Thursday morning. Walters, meanwhile, was arrested in Las Vegas Wednesday and charged with insider trading; he's set to appear in court Thursday. (The New York Times offers a more in-depth look, including more on Walters, often said to be the best sports bettor in the US.)",Phil Mickelson Made Nearly $____M on Insider Trading: SEC,"Round(Paraphrase(931,000,M),0)",1,The news was published on 19th May in the year of 2016.,"The relevant sentence in the news article states that Phil Mickelson bought 240,000 shares of Dean Foods stock and made a profit of $931,000. To determine the amount Phil Mickelson made on insider trading, we need to calculate the profit per share. We can do this by dividing the profit by the number of shares bought: $931,000 / 240,000 shares = $3.8791667 per share. Since the question asks for the amount in millions, we need to divide this result by 1 million: $3.8791667 / 1,000,000 = $0.0038791667 million per share. Finally, to find the total amount Phil Mickelson made, we multiply this result by the number of shares: $0.0038791667 million/share * 240,000 shares = $0.931 million.

The article also mentions that the affected minivans are from the model years 2005 through 2010. However, it does not specify the exact number of minivans from each year. To calculate the approximate number of minivans being recalled, we can assume an equal distribution of minivans across the model years. Therefore, we divide the total number of minivans (886,815) by the number of model years (6) to get an average of approximately 147,802 minivans per year. Since the question asks for the number of minivans in thousands, we divide this average by 1,000 to get 147.802. Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we get 148.

"(Feb 23, 2016  5:33 AM) It's  extremely likely  that sea levels rose faster in the 20th century than at any other time in the previous 2,700 years  and the rise over the last two decades has been even faster,  scientists say. A new study—based on  reconstructions  of past sea levels from 24 areas around the world, plus tide gauges—finds global sea levels were steady for almost three millennia before they began to rise with the Industrial Revolution, reports USA Today.  We can say with 95% probability that the 20th-century rise was faster than any of the previous 27 centuries,  the lead author tells the Washington Post. Sea levels rose 5.5 inches from 1900 to 2000, or about 1.4 millimeters per year. NASA puts the current rate at 3.4 millimeters per year. Scientists expect sea levels to rise between 9.5 inches and 2 feet by 2100—if we stick to the climate treaty agreed upon in Paris. But a high emissions scenario could see seas rise by more than 4 feet.

There's no surprise why: Humans burned fossil fuels, which produced greenhouse gases, which melted glaciers and warmed ocean waters, scientists say.

To derive the answer, we need to calculate the number of years it would take for sea levels to rise by 5.5 inches at a rate of 1.4 millimeters per year. 

First, we convert 5.5 inches to millimeters. Since 1 inch is equal to 25.4 millimeters, 5.5 inches is equal to 139.7 millimeters.

Next, we divide 139.7 millimeters by 1.4 millimeters per year to find the number of years it would take for sea levels to rise by 5.5 inches. The result is approximately 99.79 years.

Unearthed documents show how one of the  most controversial figures in American medical history,  Walter Freeman—who made the ice-pick-through-the-eye, transorbital method famous and used lobotomies to treat  practically everything from delinquency to a pain in the neck,  one VA memo notes—swayed the organization in favor of the procedure, despite the fact that only a third of patients were able to lead a  productive life  afterward. After doctors saw Freeman perform a lobotomy in 1943, a VA report recommended the surgery be performed on veterans suffering from mental illnesses. The memo, which noted a lobotomy  does not demand a high degree of surgical skill,  was approved. The US government went on to lobotomize some 2,000 veterans with Freeman in the lead, the WSJ notes. And while many at the VA had their doubts—in one case, Freeman posed for a photo op during surgery and penetrated too far into the patient's brain, killing the patient—the neurology division's chief wrote that if properly handed, the advantages  outweigh the disadvantages.

This sentence provides the total number of veterans who were lobotomized. To determine the time period in which this occurred, we can refer to the sentence that mentions the 1940s and '50s. This indicates that the lobotomies took place during those two decades. 

To calculate the average number of veterans lobotomized per decade, we divide the total number of veterans lobotomized (2,000) by the number of decades (2) mentioned in the news article. 

2,000 veterans lobotomized / 2 decades = 1,000 veterans lobotomized per decade

Since each decade represents ten years, we divide the number of veterans lobotomized per decade by 10 to find the average number of veterans lobotomized per year.

1,000 veterans lobotomized per decade / 10 years = 100 veterans lobotomized per year

Underperforming funds are the hardest hit, as those with capital seek out fund managers with proven track records in a down market. But so far, Bloomberg notes, the money is staying in the industry.  We don't see investors pulling the plug across the board and putting their capital into cash,  one manager said. Fill in the blank: First Half of '____ Worst Ever for Hedge Funds"

"(Dec 10, 2015  5:17 AM) In 1971, the middle class made up 61% of the US population. That figure has now plummeted to just below half, and analysts are worried about the breakdown of what the Los Angeles Times calls  a pillar of the US economy.  A Pew Research Center report released Wednesday culled data from the Census Bureau, Labor Department, and Federal Reserve to determine that 120.8 American adults are in middle-class households, while 121.3 million are in the lower- or upper-class tiers. Pew defined middle class as any household making two-thirds to twice the overall median income; for a family of three, that range is $42,000 to $126,000. What's led to what Pew calls a  thinning in the middle and bulking up at the edges : more low-skilled immigrants to bolster the lower class, and more women in the workforce and increased college enrollment on the upper end. All of the tiers suffered during and after the Great Recession, but the middle class saw the financial gains it had reaped over the last quarter-century virtually wiped out: The median wealth of a middle-class household in 1983 was $95,879, a number that rose to $161,050 by 2007. But after the recession, median wealth for this group was back down to $98,000 in 2010 and remained at that number until at least 2013, the Pew report notes. A recent Gallup poll also shows that people's perceptions are in line with what the Pew report shows: In 2008, 63% of Americans identified as being part of the middle class, while the poll given this spring shows that number has dropped to 51%. (Plug in your own numbers to see where you fall on the income spectrum.)",Middle Class Plummets to Less Than ____% of US,"Subtract(100,61)",50,The news was published on 10th December in the year of 2015.,"The relevant sentences in the news article state that in 1971, the middle class made up 61% of the US population, and that figure has now plummeted to just below half. The article also mentions that a Pew Research Center report released in 2015 determined that there are 120.8 million American adults in middle-class households, while 121.3 million are in the lower or upper-class tiers. 

To derive the answer, we can calculate the percentage of the US population that the middle class represents. We divide the number of American adults in middle-class households (120.8 million) by the total number of American adults (121.3 million) and multiply by 100 to get the percentage. 

(120.8 million / 121.3 million) * 100 = 99.59%

Therefore, the middle class represents approximately 99.59% of the US population. However, the news article states that the figure has plummeted to just below half. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question is 50.

"(Dec 12, 2014  10:13 AM) Dr. Autumn Klein died of cyanide poisoning in 2013; her husband, Dr. Robert Ferrante, was convicted of her murder last month. Cyanide poisoning is rare, killing just seven people in the US in 2012—which is why it's especially strange that five days after Ferrante's conviction, another doctor at the hospital where Klein worked also died of cyanide poisoning. Nicole Kotchey, 35, was found unconscious near her desk at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center on the morning of Nov. 12 and died less than four hours later, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. Now, investigators are trying to determine whether her death was a homicide, a suicide, or an accident, the Guardian reports.  To have one—let alone two—is extraordinarily unusual,  says the Allegheny County chief medical examiner, who adds that he doesn't know why his office would perform such an obscure test for cyanide on Kotchey, but assumes it was because of what happened to Klein. In fact, Klein's colleagues were initially stumped by her sudden and mysterious illness, which lasted three days before she died; they finally  ordered everything including the kitchen sink,  the medical examiner says,  and the cyanide test was part of that kitchen sink.  In her case, Ferrante ordered the chemical and gave it to his wife in a drink he said would help her conceive, but investigators are stumped as to what happened to Kotchey, a molecular biologist. It is possible to ingest, inhale, or absorb via skin a lethal amount of cyanide, but a molecular biology professor says people who work with cyanide are  obviously very aware of its risks —and it's not even clear whether Kotchey did work with cyanide. Cyanide purchases are scrutinized, the professor adds, so investigators are likely looking to see if anyone has purchased it recently. Click for more on Klein's murder.

To derive the answer, we need to understand that the hospital had already experienced one death from cyanide poisoning, which was Dr. Autumn Klein's case. The news article states that it is strange to have two deaths from cyanide poisoning, considering that cyanide poisoning is rare. Therefore, the hospital seeing a ""2nd death"" from cyanide indicates that there was already one previous death.

"(Jul 31, 2015  2:45 PM CDT) In what might be the most incredible iPhone testimonial ever, a Texas man has revealed that his iPhone still works—an iPhone that happened to fall out of an airplane and tumble 9,300 feet into a pasture. Ben Wilson, 74, explains that he was en route from Houston to Kickapoo Airport midday Monday when a pressure change affected a door latch on the Beechcraft Bonanza plane. He saw his Wall Street Journal fly out the gap; when they landed, he realized his phone was MIA. The Find My iPhone app revealed it was alive and well some 90 miles away outside of Joplin, and Wilson—owner of Gas Corp. of America—and his VP of sales (who is also his stepson) set off from Wichita Falls to retrieve it on Tuesday. Their journey took them down a ranch road, over a fence, past a friendly donkey, and to a mesquite tree, reports the Times Record News. Beneath that tree was the phone,  in one piece, scratched a bit on the corners but it still worked,  says Wilson. He tells NBC News the screen wasn't shattered, and only one element was missing: a protective case that contained an external battery. Wilson says he confirmed the distance his iPhone fell thanks to another bit of technology: the flight-tracking site FlightAware, which provided his altitude.

To derive the answer, we need to use the information provided in the sentences. The first sentence states that the iPhone fell 9,300 feet, and the second sentence mentions that Wilson confirmed this distance using the flight-tracking site FlightAware, which provided his altitude.

Therefore, the numerical reasoning steps are as follows:
1. Identify the distance mentioned in the first sentence: 9,300 feet.
2. Confirm the distance using FlightAware, as mentioned in the second sentence.
3. Since the confirmation was made using FlightAware, we can conclude that the distance is accurate.

The article does not explicitly mention the number of missing tenants, but it does state that the rest are accounted for, implying that there are some missing. Therefore, to find the number of missing tenants, we subtract the number of tenants accounted for (105) from the total number of tenants (150). 

150 - 105 = 45

"(Jun 5, 2014  8:57 AM CDT) Ray Tomlinson set out from Michigan to Arizona to pick up his girlfriend from a mental health facility Sunday—then drove nearly all of the 1,900-mile return trek with her dead body propped up in the passenger seat. Somewhere in New Mexico, Tomlinson nudged her and  she was stiff,  he tells WDIV.  There wasn't jerking or moans or groans, or cries for help, she just fell asleep.  Rather than call police, Tomlinson propped the body up, slapped sunglasses on the woman's face, and put a stuffed animal in her lap, WJBK reports. He and his 93-year-old mom then continued to drive for 26 hours—without air conditioning. When health officials called the woman's cell to check on her, Tomlinson told them she was dead, but refused to contact police. His plan? After looking up what to do with a dead body on his phone, he learned he'd have 48 hours to get the woman to a morgue, and planned to take her to one in Michigan. Michigan authorities, however, met Tomlinson after the facility gave them a ring. Police are awaiting a toxicology report but say the woman may have taken several oxycodone pills while stopped at a Flagstaff gas station. No charges have been filed, but the local prosecutor's office is reviewing the case.",Man Drives ____K Miles With Girlfriend's Corpse,"Round(Paraphrase(1,900,K),0)",2,The news was published on 5th June in the year of 2014.,"The relevant sentences in the news article are ""Ray Tomlinson set out from Michigan to Arizona to pick up his girlfriend from a mental health facility Sunday—then drove nearly all of the 1,900-mile return trek with her dead body propped up in the passenger seat"" and ""He and his 93-year-old mom then continued to drive for 26 hours—without air conditioning.""

To derive the answer, we need to calculate the distance driven by Ray Tomlinson and his mother. The news states that they drove nearly all of the 1,900-mile return trek, which means they covered a distance close to 1,900 miles. Additionally, they continued to drive for 26 hours without air conditioning. 

To calculate the distance driven, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. However, since we don't have the speed, we can estimate the average speed based on the given information. Assuming they drove at a constant speed, we can divide the total distance by the total time to get the average speed.

Let's assume they drove at an average speed of 70 miles per hour (mph). Using the formula, Distance = Speed x Time, we can rearrange it to Time = Distance / Speed. 

For the 1,900-mile return trek, the estimated time taken would be 1,900 miles / 70 mph = 27.14 hours. 

Since they continued to drive for an additional 26 hours without air conditioning, the total time taken would be 27.14 hours + 26 hours = 53.14 hours.

Now, to calculate the distance driven, we can use the formula Distance = Speed x Time. Using the average speed of 70 mph and the total time of 53.14 hours, the distance driven would be 70 mph x 53.14 hours = 3,699.8 miles.

Therefore, the answer to the fill-in-the-blank question ""Man Drives ____K Miles With Girlfriend's Corpse"" is 3,700K miles, which is equivalent to 3,700,000 miles.

To determine the number of pelicans that have died, we can subtract the number of pelicans found dead from the total number of dead sea creatures mentioned in the article. The article states that a total of 538 pelicans, 54 boobies, five sea lions, and a turtle have been found dead. By subtracting the number of boobies (54), sea lions (5), and the turtle (1) from the total number of dead sea creatures (538), we can find the number of pelicans that have died. 

538 - 54 - 5 - 1 = 478

Therefore, the number of pelicans that have died is 478. However, the question asks for the number of pelicans that have died, so we need to subtract this number from the total number of pelicans mentioned in the article. The article does not provide the total number of pelicans, so we cannot determine the exact number. However, we can assume that the number of dead pelicans is significant compared to the total number of pelicans, given that the Peruvian government officials are deeply worried about the situation. Therefore, we can estimate that a large number of pelicans have died, possibly around 500.

So the answer is 500.","The news was published on 30th April in the year of 2012. News: More dead sea creatures are turning up on the shores of Peru.

This move allowed Google to cut its overall tax rate almost in half. The sentence also mentions that this figure is nearly double what Google funneled overseas three years earlier and represents roughly 80% of the company's pretax profits. 

To derive the answer, we need to calculate the amount of taxes that Google avoided by shifting $9.8 billion in revenue to Bermuda. Since this amount represents roughly 80% of the company's pretax profits, we can calculate the pretax profits by dividing $9.8 billion by 0.8. 

Pretax profits = $9.8 billion / 0.8 = $12.25 billion

Next, we need to calculate the amount of taxes that Google would have paid if it did not shift the revenue to Bermuda. Since the move allowed Google to cut its overall tax rate almost in half, we can calculate the taxes avoided by multiplying the pretax profits by 0.5.

Taxes avoided = $12.25 billion * 0.5 = $6.125 billion

Wall Street economists forecast that claims would drop. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose by 8,000 to 482,500, the highest since December. There were no special factors that distorted the numbers, a Labor Department analyst said. The increase suggests the economy is creating even fewer jobs than in the first half of this year, when private employers added an average of about 100,000 jobs per month—barely enough to keep the unemployment rate from rising.",Jobless Claims Hit ____-Month High,"Add(Add(12,Trans(November)),Trans(Trans(Aug)))",9,The news was published on 19th August in the year of 2010.,"To derive the answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the news article. The article states that new applications for unemployment insurance reached the half-million mark last week for the first time since November. It also mentions that the four-week average rose by 8,000 to 482,500, the highest since December. From this information, we can infer that the number of jobless claims has been increasing steadily. Since the article was published in August, we can assume that the highest number of jobless claims occurred in the previous week. Therefore, the jobless claims hit a 9-month high, as November was nine months prior to August. So the answer is 9.","The news was published on 19th August in the year of 2010.

"(Jun 3, 2013  4:53 PM CDT) Things have come so far since Meg Ryan falling in love with Tom Hanks over AOL was considered a novel enough concept to make a film about it. Now more than a third of marriages in the US start out online, according to a survey of 19,000 people who married between 2005 and 2012. Of those who hooked up virtually before physically, 45% met through dating sites, while others met through chat sites, forums, and social media, reports USA Today. The study has caused some controversy, however: The research was commissioned and financed by dating site eHarmony. Lead author John Cacioppo is a psychologist and the director of the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience at the University of Chicago ... but also on eHarmony's Scientific Advisory Board. But Cacioppo, who did the study with two independent statisticians from Harvard, defends the results.  I set stipulations that it would be about science and not about eHarmony,  he says.  I had an agreement with eHarmony that I had complete control and we would publish no matter what we found and the data would be available to everyone.",____% of Marriages Now Begin Online,"Round(Multiply(Trans(a third),100),0)",33,The news was published on 3rd June in the year of 2013.,"The relevant sentence in the news article states that ""more than a third of marriages in the US start out online, according to a survey of 19,000 people who married between 2005 and 2012."" This sentence provides the necessary information to determine the percentage of marriages that begin online. 

To calculate this percentage, we need to divide the number of marriages that started online by the total number of marriages surveyed and then multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage. The news article does not provide the exact number of marriages surveyed, but it mentions that the survey was conducted with 19,000 people who married between 2005 and 2012. Therefore, we can assume that the total number of marriages surveyed is 19,000.

Using this information, we can calculate the percentage of marriages that begin online as follows:

(Number of marriages that begin online / Total number of marriages surveyed) * 100

Substituting the values, we get:

(Number of marriages that begin online / 19,000) * 100

Since the news article does not provide the exact number of marriages that begin online, we cannot calculate the exact percentage. However, the news article states that ""more than a third of marriages in the US start out online."" Therefore, we can conclude that the percentage is greater than 33%.

So the answer is 33.","The news was published on 3rd June in the year of 2013.

"(Feb 19, 2015  10:19 AM) Reddit is feeling generous: After raking in nearly $8.3 million in advertising revenue in 2014, the site has decided to  support the goals and causes of the entire community  by donating 10% of that amount to 10 charities. The company made the announcement in a blog post, noting the $827,659.49 will be split evenly, so each charity will receive $82,765.95. Now here's the fun part: Reddit users will help choose which charities get a check. The rules are designed to  reduce any potential shenanigans : Anyone with a Reddit account before 10am PST yesterday (the announcement came at 10:01) can vote a single time per charity, but for as many charities as he or she would like. Redditors can look up charities via the Charity Navigator database then vote on Reddit's donate page. Voting wraps up Wednesday. Mashable points out Reddit's $8.3 million in ad revenue is rather measly compared to BuzzFeed's earnings; that site passed the $100 million mark in 2014. (Per similarwb.com, Reddit gets more traffic than Buzzfeed.) The discrepancy is probably due, at least in part, to Reddit's tiny banner ads. Electronic Frontier Foundation, Doctors Without Borders, NPR, the Wikimedia Foundation, and Internet Archive were the most discussed charities on Reddit yesterday, CNNMoney reported, and they remain that way today.

To find out how much each charity will receive, we need to divide the total amount by the number of charities. So, the numerical reasoning steps are as follows: 

1. Total amount being donated by Reddit = $827,659.49
2. Number of charities = 10
3. Divide the total amount by the number of charities: $827,659.49 / 10 = $82,765.95

"(Feb 7, 2015  6:05 PM) China has taken a strong interest in the intimate details of Hong Kong hygiene. Officials in China's south have seized some 8,000 rolls of toilet paper marked with the face of Leung Chun-ying, Hong Kong's chief executive, the AP reports.

The Beijing-appointed leader is considered by many in Hong Kong to be the mainland's  puppet,  NPR notes, and products that make fun of him have been big sellers, the BBC reports. Hong Kong's Democratic Party had intended to hawk the toilet paper at an upcoming fair; last year, 4,000 rolls of the stuff sold out, the AP reports.

Therefore, we can conclude that each roll of toilet paper is worth $12,900 divided by 8,000, which equals $1.6125. Since the question asks for the value in thousands, we need to divide this amount by 1,000, which gives us $0.0016125.
